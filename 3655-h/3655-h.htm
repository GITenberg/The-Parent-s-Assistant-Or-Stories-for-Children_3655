<h2>PREFACE,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ADDRESSED TO PARENTS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> great lexicographer, in his
celebrated eulogium on Dr. Watts, thus speaks in commendation of
those productions which he so successfully penned for the
pleasure and instruction of the juvenile portion of the
community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For children,&rdquo; says Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;he
condescended to lay aside the philosopher, the scholar, and the
wit, to write little poems of devotion, and systems of
instruction adapted to their wants and capacities, from the dawn
of reason to its gradation of advance in the morning of
life.&nbsp; Every man acquainted with the common principles of
human action, will look with veneration on the writer, who is at
one time combating Locke, and at another time making a catechism
for <i>children in their fourth year</i>.&nbsp; A voluntary
descent from the dignity of science is perhaps the hardest lesson
which humility can teach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems, however, no very easy task to write for
children.&nbsp; Those only who have been interested in the
education of a family, who have patiently followed children
through the first processes of reasoning, who have daily watched
over their thoughts and feelings&mdash;those only who know with
what ease and rapidity the early association of ideas are formed,
on which the future taste, character and happiness depend, can
feel the dangers and difficulties of such an undertaking.</p>
<p>Indeed, in all sciences the grand difficulty has been to
ascertain facts&mdash;a difficulty which, in the science of
education, peculiar circumstances conspire to increase.&nbsp;
Here the objects of every experiment are so interesting that we
cannot hold our minds indifferent to the result.&nbsp; Nor is it
to be expected that many registers of experiments, successful and
unsuccessful, should be kept, much less should be published, when
we consider that the combined powers of affection and vanity, of
partiality to his child and to his theory, will act upon the mind
of a parent, in opposition to the abstract love of justice, and
the general desire to increase the wisdom and happiness of
mankind.&nbsp; Notwithstanding these difficulties, an attempt to
keep such a register has actually been made.&nbsp; The design has
from time to time been pursued.&nbsp; Though much has not been
collected, every circumstance and conversation that have been
preserved are faithfully and accurately related, and these notes
have been of great advantage to the writer of the following
stories.</p>
<p>The question, whether society could exist without the
distinction of ranks, is a question involving a variety of
complicated discussions, which we leave to the politician and the
legislator.&nbsp; At present it is necessary that the education
of different ranks should, in some respects, be different.&nbsp;
They have few ideas, few habits in common; their peculiar vices
and virtues do not arise from the same causes, and their ambition
is to be directed to different objects.&nbsp; But justice, truth,
and humanity are confined to no particular rank, and should be
enforced with equal care and energy upon the minds of young
people of every station; and it is hoped that these principles
have never been forgotten in the following pages.</p>
<p>As the ideas of children multiply, the language of their books
should become less simple; else their taste will quickly be
disgusted, or will remain stationary.&nbsp; Children that live
with people who converse with elegance will not be contented with
a style inferior to what they hear from everybody near them.</p>
<p>All poetical allusions, however, have been avoided in this
book; such situations only are described as children can easily
imagine, and which may consequently interest their
feelings.&nbsp; Such examples of virtue are painted as are not
above their conception of excellence, or their powers of sympathy
and emulation.</p>
<p>It is not easy to give <i>rewards</i> to children which shall
not indirectly do them harm by fostering some hurtful taste or
passion.&nbsp; In the story of &ldquo;Lazy Lawrence,&rdquo; where
the object was to excite a spirit of industry, care has been
taken to proportion the reward to the exertion, and to
demonstrate that people feel cheerful and happy whilst they are
employed.&nbsp; The reward of our industrious boy, though it be
money, is only money considered as the means of gratifying a
benevolent wish.&nbsp; In a commercial nation it is especially
necessary to separate, as much as possible, the spirit of
industry and avarice; and to beware lest we introduce Vice under
the form of Virtue.</p>
<p>In the story of &ldquo;Tarlton and Loveit&rdquo; are
represented the danger and the folly of that weakness of mind,
and that easiness to be led, which too often pass for good
nature; and in the tale of the &ldquo;False Key&rdquo; are
pointed out some of the evils to which a well educated boy, on
first going to service, is exposed from the profligacy of his
fellow servants.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Birthday Present,&rdquo; and in the character of
Mrs. Theresa Tattle, the &ldquo;Parent&rsquo;s Assistant&rdquo;
has pointed out the dangers which may arise in education from a
bad servant, or a common acquaintance.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Barring Out&rdquo; the errors to which a high
spirit and the love of party are apt to lead have been made the
subject of correction, and it is hoped that the common fault of
making the most mischievous characters appear the most
<i>active</i> and the most ingenious, has been as much as
possible avoided.&nbsp; <i>Unsuccessful</i> cunning will not be
admired, and cannot induce imitation.</p>
<p>It has been attempted, in these stories, to provide antidotes
against ill-humour, the epidemic rage for dissipation, and the
fatal propensity to admire and imitate whatever the fashion of
the moment may distinguish.&nbsp; Were young people, either in
public schools, or in private families, absolutely free from bad
examples, it would not be advisable to introduce despicable and
vicious characters in books intended for their improvement.&nbsp;
But in real life they <i>must</i> see vice, and it is best that
they should be early shocked with the representation of what they
are to avoid.&nbsp; There is a great deal of difference between
innocence and ignorance.</p>
<p>To prevent the precepts of morality from tiring the ear and
the mind, it was necessary to make the stories in which they are
introduced in some measure dramatic; to keep alive hope and fear
and curiosity, by some degree of intricacy.&nbsp; At the same
time, care has been taken to avoid inflaming the imagination, or
exciting a restless spirit of adventure, by exhibiting false
views of life, and creating hopes which, in the ordinary course
of things, cannot be realized.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE
ORPHANS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Near</span> the ruins of the castle of
Rossmore, in Ireland, is a small cabin, in which there once lived
a widow and her four children.&nbsp; As long as she was able to
work, she was very industrious, and was accounted the best
spinner in the parish; but she overworked herself at last, and
fell ill, so that she could not sit to her wheel as she used to
do, and was obliged to give it up to her eldest daughter,
Mary.</p>
<p>Mary was at this time about twelve years old.&nbsp; One
evening she was sitting at the foot of her mother&rsquo;s bed
spinning, and her little brothers and sisters were gathered round
the fire eating their potatoes and milk for supper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bless them, the poor young creatures!&rdquo; said the
widow, who, as she lay on her bed, which she knew must be her
deathbed, was thinking of what would become of her children after
she was gone.&nbsp; Mary stopped her wheel, for she was afraid
that the noise of it had wakened her mother, and would hinder her
from going to sleep again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to stop the wheel, Mary, dear, for me,&rdquo;
said her mother, &ldquo;I was not asleep; nor is it <i>that</i>
which keeps me from sleep.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t overwork
yourself, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no fear of that,&rdquo; replied Mary;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong and hearty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I once,&rdquo; said her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you will be again, I hope,&rdquo; said Mary,
&ldquo;when the fine weather comes again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fine weather will never come again to me,&rdquo;
said her mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a folly, Mary, to hope
for that; but what I hope is, that you&rsquo;ll find some
friend&mdash;some help&mdash;orphans as you&rsquo;ll soon all of
you be.&nbsp; And one thing comforts my heart, even as I
<i>am</i> lying here, that not a soul in the wide world I am
leaving has to complain of me.&nbsp; Though poor I have lived
honest, and I have brought you up to be the same, Mary; and I am
sure the little ones will take after you; for you&rsquo;ll be
good to them&mdash;as good to them as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the children, who had finished eating their suppers, came
round the bed, to listen to what their mother was saying.&nbsp;
She was tired of speaking, for she was very weak; but she took
their little hands, as they laid them on the bed and joining them
all together, she said, &ldquo;Bless you, dears; bless you; love
and help one another all you can.&nbsp; Good
night!&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary took the children away to their bed, for she saw that
their mother was too ill to say more; but Mary did not herself
know how ill she was.&nbsp; Her mother never spoke rightly
afterwards, but talked in a confused way about some debts, and
one in particular, which she owed to a schoolmistress for
Mary&rsquo;s schooling; and then she charged Mary to go and pay
it, because she was not able to <i>go in</i> with it.&nbsp; At
the end of the week she was dead and buried, and the orphans were
left alone in their cabin.</p>
<p>The two youngest girls, Peggy and Nancy, were six and seven
years old.&nbsp; Edmund was not yet nine, but he was a
stout-grown, healthy boy, and well disposed to work.&nbsp; He had
been used to bring home turf from the bog on his back, to lead
cart-horses, and often to go on errands for gentlemen&rsquo;s
families, who paid him a sixpence or a shilling, according to the
distance which he went, so that Edmund, by some or other of these
little employments, was, as he said, likely enough to earn his
bread; and he told Mary to have a good heart, for that he should
every year grow able to do more and more, and that he should
never forget his mother&rsquo;s words when she last gave him her
blessing, and joined their hands all together.</p>
<p>As for Peggy and Nancy, it was little that they could do; but
they were good children, and Mary, when she considered that so
much depended upon her, was resolved to exert herself to the
utmost.&nbsp; Her first care was to pay those debts which her
mother had mentioned to her, for which she left money done up
carefully in separate papers.&nbsp; When all these were paid
away, there was not enough left to pay both the rent of the cabin
and a year&rsquo;s schooling for herself and sisters which was
due to the schoolmistress in a neighbouring village.</p>
<p>Mary was in hopes that the rent would not be called for
immediately, but in this she was disappointed.&nbsp; Mr. Harvey,
the gentleman on whose estate she lived, was in England, and, in
his absence, all was managed by a Mr. Hopkins, an agent, who was
a <i>hard man</i>. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a>&nbsp; The driver came to Mary about a
week after her mother&rsquo;s death, and told her that the rent
must be brought in the next day, and that she must leave the
cabin, for a new tenant was coming into it; that she was too
young to have a house to herself, and that the only thing she had
to do was to get some neighbour to take her and her brother and
her sisters in for charity&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>The driver finished by hinting that she would not be so hardly
used if she had not brought upon herself the ill-will of Miss
Alice, the agent&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Mary, it is true, had
refused to give Miss Alice a goat upon which she had set her
fancy; but this was the only offence of which she had been
guilty, and at the time she refused it her mother wanted the
goat&rsquo;s milk, which was the only thing she then liked to
drink.</p>
<p>Mary went immediately to Mr. Hopkins, the agent, to pay her
rent; and she begged of him to let her stay another year in her
cabin; but this he refused.&nbsp; It was now September 25th, and
he said that the new tenant must come in on the 29th, so that she
must quit it directly.&nbsp; Mary could not bear the thoughts of
begging any of the neighbours to take her and her brother and
sisters in <i>for charity&rsquo;s sake</i>; for the neighbours
were all poor enough themselves.&nbsp; So she bethought herself
that she might find shelter in the ruins of the old castle of
Rossmore where she and her brother, in better times, had often
played at hide and seek.&nbsp; The kitchen and two other rooms
near it were yet covered in tolerably well; and a little thatch,
she thought, would make them comfortable through the
winter.&nbsp; The agent consented to let her and her brother and
sisters go in there, upon her paying him half a guinea in hand,
and promising to pay the same yearly.</p>
<p>Into these lodgings the orphans now removed, taking with them
two bedsteads, a stool, chair and a table, a sort of press, which
contained what little clothes they had, and a chest in which they
had two hundred of meal.&nbsp; The chest was carried for them by
some of the charitable neighbours, who likewise added to their
scanty stock of potatoes and turf what would make it last through
the winter.</p>
<p>These children were well thought of and pitied, because their
mother was known to have been all her life honest and
industrious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; says one of the
neighbours, &ldquo;we can do no less than give a helping hand to
the poor orphans, that are so ready to help
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; So one helped to thatch the room in
which they were to sleep, and another took their cow to graze
upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk; and
one and all said they should be welcome to take share of their
potatoes and buttermilk if they should find their own ever fall
short.</p>
<p>The half-guinea which Mr. Hopkins, the agent, required for
letting Mary into the castle, was part of what she had to pay to
the schoolmistress, to whom above a guinea was due.&nbsp; Mary
went to her, and took her goat along with her, and offered it in
part of payment of the debt, but the schoolmistress would not
receive the goat. She said that she could afford to wait for her
money till Mary was able to pay it; that she knew her to be an
honest, industrious little girl, and she would trust her with
more than a guinea.&nbsp; Mary thanked her; and she was glad to
take the goat home again, as she was very fond of it.</p>
<p>Being now settled in their house, they went every day
regularly to work; Maud spun nine cuts a day, besides doing all
that was to be done in the house; Edmund got fourpence a day by
his work; and Peggy and Annie earned twopence apiece at the
paper-mills near Navan, where they were employed to sort rags,
and to cut them into small pieces.</p>
<p>When they had done work one day, Annie went to the master of
the paper-mill and asked him if she might have two sheets of
large white paper which were lying on the press.&nbsp; She
offered a penny for the paper; but the master would not take
anything from her, but gave her the paper when he found that she
wanted it to make a garland for her mother&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp;
Annie and Peggy cut out the garland, and Mary, when it was
finished, went along with them and Edmund to put it up.&nbsp; It
was just a month after their mother&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>It happened, at the time the orphans were putting up this
garland, that two young ladies, who were returning home after
their evening walk, stopped at the gate of the churchyard to look
at the red light which the setting sun cast upon the window of
the church.&nbsp; As the ladies were standing at the gate, they
heard a voice near them crying, &ldquo;O, mother! mother! are you
gone for ever?&rdquo;&nbsp; They could not see anyone, so they
walked softly round to the other side of the church, and there
they saw Mary kneeling beside a grave, on which her brothers and
sisters were hanging their white garlands.</p>
<p>The children all stood still when they saw the two ladies
passing near them; but Mary did not know anybody was passing, for
her face was hid in her hands.</p>
<p>Isabella and Caroline (so these ladies were called) would not
disturb the poor children; but they stopped in the village to
inquire about them.&nbsp; It was at the house of the
schoolmistress that they stopped, and she gave them a good
account of these orphans.&nbsp; She particularly commended
Mary&rsquo;s honesty, in having immediately paid all her
mother&rsquo;s debts to the utmost farthing, as far as her money
would go.&nbsp; She told the ladies how Mary had been turned out
of her house, and how she had offered her goat, of which she was
very fond, to discharge a debt due for her schooling; and, in
short, the schoolmistress, who had known Mary for several years,
spoke so well of her that these ladies resolved that they would
go to the old castle of Rossmore to see her the next day.</p>
<p>When they went there, they found the room in which the
children lived as clean and neat as such a ruined place could be
made.&nbsp; Edmund was out working with a farmer, Mary was
spinning, and her little sisters were measuring out some
bogberries, of which they had gathered a basketful, for
sale.&nbsp; Isabella, after telling Mary what an excellent
character she had heard of her, inquired what it was she most
wanted; and Mary said that she had just worked up all her flax,
and she was most in want of more flax for her wheel.</p>
<p>Isabella promised that she would send her a fresh supply of
flax, and Caroline bought the bogberries from the little girls,
and gave them money enough to buy a pound of coarse cotton for
knitting, as Mary said that she could teach them how to knit.</p>
<p>The supply of flax, which Isabella sent the next day, was of
great service to Mary, as it kept her in employment for above a
month; and when she sold the yarn which she had spun with it, she
had money enough to buy some warm flannel for winter wear.&nbsp;
Besides spinning well, she had learned at school to do plain work
tolerably neatly, and Isabella and Caroline employed her to work
for them; by which she earned a great deal more than she could by
spinning.&nbsp; At her leisure hours she taught her sisters to
read and write; and Edmund, with part of the money which he
earned by his work out of doors, paid a schoolmaster for teaching
him a little arithmetic.&nbsp; When the winter nights came on, he
used to light his rush candles for Mary to work by.&nbsp; He had
gathered and stripped a good provision of rushes in the month of
August, and a neighbour gave him grease to dip them in.</p>
<p>One evening, just as he had lighted his candles, a footman
came in, who was sent by Isabella with some plain work to
Mary.&nbsp; This servant was an Englishman, and he was but newly
come over to Ireland.&nbsp; The rush candles caught his
attention; for he had never seen any of them before, as he came
from a part of England where they were not used.&nbsp; Edmund,
who was ready to oblige, and proud that his candles were noticed
showed the Englishman how they were made, and gave him a bundle
of rushes. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>The servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling
instance, and remembered it long after it was forgotten by
Edmund.&nbsp; Whenever his master wanted to send a messenger
anywhere, Gilbert (for that was the servant&rsquo;s name) always
employed his little friend Edmund, whom, upon further
acquaintance, he liked better and better.&nbsp; He found that
Edmund was both quick and exact in executing commissions.</p>
<p>One day, after he had waited a great while at a
gentleman&rsquo;s house for an answer to a letter, he was so
impatient to get home that he ran off without it.&nbsp; When he
was questioned by Gilbert why he did not bring an answer, he did
not attempt to make any excuse; he did not say, &ldquo;<i>There
was no answer</i>, <i>please your honour</i>,&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;<i>They bid me not to wait</i>,&rdquo; etc.; but he told
exactly the truth; and though Gilbert scolded him for being so
impatient as not to wait, yet his telling the truth was more to
the boy&rsquo;s advantage than any excuse he could have
made.&nbsp; After this he was always believed when he said,
&ldquo;<i>There was no answer</i>,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;<i>They bid
me not wait</i>&rdquo;; for Gilbert knew that he would not tell a
lie to save himself from being scolded.</p>
<p>The orphans continued to assist one another in their work
according to their strength and abilities; and they went on in
this manner for three years.&nbsp; With what Mary got by her
spinning and plain work, and Edmund by leading of cart-horses,
going on errands, etc., and with little Peggy and Anne&rsquo;s
earnings, the family contrived to live comfortably.&nbsp;
Isabella and Caroline often visited them, and sometimes gave them
clothes, and sometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and
knitting; and these children did not <i>expect</i>, that because
the ladies did something for them, they should do
everything.&nbsp; They did not grow idle or wasteful.</p>
<p>When Edmund was about twelve years old, his friend Gilbert
sent for him one day, and told him that his master had given him
leave to have a boy in the house to assist him, and that his
master told him he might choose one in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
Several were anxious to get into such a good place: but Gilbert
said that he preferred Edmund before them all, because he knew
him to be an industrious, honest, good natured lad, who always
told the truth.&nbsp; So Edmund went into service at the
vicarage; and his master was the father of Isabella and
Caroline.&nbsp; He found his new way of life very pleasant; for
he was well fed, well clothed, and well treated; and he every day
learned more of his business, in which at first he was rather
awkward.&nbsp; He was mindful to do all that Mr. Gilbert required
of him; and he was so obliging to all his fellow-servants that
they could not help liking him.&nbsp; But there was one thing
which was at first rather disagreeable to him: he was obliged to
wear shoes and stockings, and they hurt his feet.&nbsp; Besides
this, when he waited at dinner he made such a noise in walking
that his fellow-servants laughed at him.&nbsp; He told his sister
Mary of his distress, and she made for him, after many trials, a
pair of cloth shoes, with soles of platted hemp. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; In these he could walk without
making the least noise; and as these shoes could not be worn out
of doors, he was always sure to change them before he went out;
and consequently he had always clean shoes to wear in the
house.</p>
<p>It was soon remarked by the men-servants that he had left off
clumping so heavily, and it was observed by the maids that he
never dirtied the stairs or passages with his shoes.&nbsp; When
he was praised for these things, he said it was his sister Mary
who should be thanked, and not he; and he showed the shoes which
she had made for him.</p>
<p>Isabella&rsquo;s maid bespoke a pair immediately, and sent
Mary a piece of pretty calico for the outside.&nbsp; The
last-maker made a last for her, and over this Mary sewed the
calico vamps tight.&nbsp; Her brother advised her to try platted
packthread instead of hemp for the soles; and she found that this
looked more neat than the hemp soles, and was likely to last
longer.&nbsp; She platted the packthread together in strands of
about half an inch thick, and these were served firmly together
at the bottom of the shoe.&nbsp; When they were finished they
fitted well, and the maid showed them to her mistress.</p>
<p>Isabella and Caroline were so well pleased with Mary&rsquo;s
ingenuity and kindness to her brother, that they bespoke from her
two dozen of these shoes, and gave her three yards of coloured
fustian to make them of, and galloon for the binding.&nbsp; When
the shoes were completed, Isabella and Caroline disposed of them
for her amongst their acquaintance, and got three shillings a
pair for them.&nbsp; The young ladies, as soon as they had
collected the money, walked to the old castle, where they found
everything neat and clean as usual.&nbsp; They had great pleasure
in giving to this industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity,
which she received with some surprise and more gratitude.&nbsp;
They advised her to continue the shoemaking trade, as they found
the shoes were liked, and they knew that they could have a sale
for them at the Repository in Dublin.</p>
<p>Mary, encouraged by these kind friends, went on with her
little manufacture with increased activity.&nbsp; Peggy and Anne
platted the packthread, and basted the vamps and linings together
ready for her.&nbsp; Edmund was allowed to come home for an hour
every morning, provided he was back again before eight
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It was summer time, and he got up early,
because he liked to go home to see his sisters, and he took his
share in the manufactory.&nbsp; It was his business to hammer the
soles flat: and as soon as he came home every morning he
performed his task with so much cheerfulness and sang so merrily
at his work, that the hour of his arrival was always an hour of
joy to the family.</p>
<p>Mary had presently employment enough upon her hands.&nbsp;
Orders came to her for shoes from many families in the
neighbourhood, and she could not get them finished fast
enough.&nbsp; She, however, in the midst of her hurry, found time
to make a very pretty pair, with neat roses, as a present for her
schoolmistress, who, now that she saw her pupil in a good way of
business, consented to receive the amount of her old debt.&nbsp;
Several of the children who went to her school were delighted
with the sight of Mary&rsquo;s present, and went to the little
manufactory at Rossmore Castle, to find out how these shoes were
made.&nbsp; Some went from curiosity, others from idleness; but
when they saw how happy the little shoemakers seemed whilst busy
at work, they longed to take some share in what was going
forward.&nbsp; One begged Mary to let her plat some packthread
for the soles; another helped Peggy and Anne to baste in the
linings; and all who could get employment were pleased, for the
idle ones were shoved out of the way.&nbsp; It became a custom
with the children of the village to resort to the old castle at
their play hours; and it was surprising to see how much was done
by ten or twelve of them, each doing but a little at a time.</p>
<p>One morning Edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled
very early, and they were busy at their work, all sitting round
the meal chest, which served them for a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hands must be washed,&rdquo; said George, a little
boy who came running in; &ldquo;I ran so fast that I might be in
time, to go to work along with you all, that I tumbled down, and
look how I have dirtied my hands.&nbsp; Most haste worst
speed.&nbsp; My hands must be washed before I can do
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst George was washing his hands, two other little
children, who had just finished their morning&rsquo;s work, came
to him to beg that he would blow some soap bubbles for them, and
they were all three eagerly blowing bubbles, and watching them
mount into the air, when suddenly they were startled by a noise
as loud as thunder.&nbsp; They were in a sort of outer court of
the castle, next to the room in which all their companions were
at work, and they ran precipitately into the room, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Did you hear that noise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a clap of thunder,&rdquo; said Mary,
&ldquo;but why do you look so frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she finished speaking, another and a louder noise, and the
walls round about them shook.&nbsp; The children turned pale and
stood motionless; but Edmund threw down his hammer, and ran out
to see what was the matter.&nbsp; Mary followed him, and they saw
that a great chimney of the old ruins at the farthest side of the
castle had fallen down, and this was the cause of the prodigious
noise.</p>
<p>The part of the castle in which they lived seemed, as Edmund
said, to be perfectly safe; but the children of the village were
terrified, and thinking that the whole would come tumbling down
directly, they ran to their homes as fast as they could.&nbsp;
Edmund, who was a courageous lad, and proud of showing his
courage, laughed at their cowardice; but Mary, who was very
prudent, persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason, who
was building at his master&rsquo;s, to come and give his opinion,
whether their part of the castle was safe to live in or
not.&nbsp; The mason came, and gave it as his opinion that the
rooms they inhabited might last through the winter but that no
part of the ruins could stand another year.&nbsp; Mary was sorry
to leave a place of which she had grown fond, poor as it was,
having lived in it in peace and contentment ever since her
mother&rsquo;s death, which was now nearly four years; but she
determined to look out for some other place to live in; and she
had now money enough to pay the rent of a comfortable
cabin.&nbsp; Without losing any time, she went to the village
that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage, for
she wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so
near to her brother, and to the ladies who had been so kind to
her.&nbsp; She found that there was one newly built house in this
village unoccupied; it belonged to Mr. Harvey, her landlord, who
was still in England; it was slated, and neatly fitted up inside;
but the rent of it was six guineas a year, and this was far above
what Mary could afford to pay.&nbsp; Three guineas a year she
thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to
engage.&nbsp; Besides, she heard that several proposals had been
made to Mr. Harvey for this house, and she knew that Mr. Hopkins,
the agent, was not her friend; therefore she despaired of getting
it.&nbsp; There was no other to be had in this village.&nbsp; Her
brother was still more vexed than she was, that she could not
find a place near him.&nbsp; He offered to give a guinea yearly
towards the rent out of his wages; and Mr. Gilbert spoke about it
for him to the steward, and inquired whether, amongst any of
those who had given in proposals, there might not be one who
would be content with a part of the house, and who would join
with Mary in paying the rent.&nbsp; None could be found but a
woman, who was a great scold, and a man who was famous for going
to law about every trifle with his neighbours.&nbsp; Mary did not
choose to have anything to do with these people.&nbsp; She did
not like to speak either to Miss Isabella or Caroline about it,
because she was not of an encroaching temper; and when they had
done so much for her, she would have been ashamed to beg for
more.&nbsp; She returned home to the old castle, mortified that
she had no good news to tell Anne and Peggy, who she knew
expected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the
village near their brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news for you, Peggy,&rdquo; cried she, as soon as
she got home.&nbsp; &ldquo;And bad news for you, Mary,&rdquo;
replied her sisters, who looked very sorrowful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your poor goat is dead,&rdquo; replied Peggy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There she is, yonder, lying under the great corner stone;
you can just see her leg.&nbsp; We cannot lift the stone from off
her, it is so heavy.&nbsp; Betsy [one of the neighbour&rsquo;s
girls] says she remembers, when she came to us to work early this
morning, she saw the goat rubbing itself, and butting with its
horns against that old tottering chimney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the time,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;that I
have driven the poor thing away from that place; I was always
afraid she would shake that great ugly stone down upon her at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goat, who had long been the favourite of Mary and her
sisters, was lamented by them all.&nbsp; When Edmund came, he
helped them to move the great stone from off the poor animal, who
was crushed so as to be a terrible sight.&nbsp; As they were
moving away this stone in order to bury the goat, Anne found an
odd-looking piece of money, which seemed neither like a
halfpenny, nor a shilling, nor a guinea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are more, a great many more of them,&rdquo; cried
Peggy; and upon searching amongst the rubbish, they discovered a
small iron pot, which seemed as if it had been filled with these
coins, as a vast number of them were found about the spot where
it fell.&nbsp; On examining these coins, Edmund thought that
several of them looked like gold, and the girls exclaimed with
great joy&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Mary! Mary! this is come to us just in
right time&mdash;now you can pay for the slated house.&nbsp;
Never was anything so lucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mary, though nothing could have pleased her better than to
have been able to pay for the house, observed that they could not
honestly touch any of this treasure, as it belonged to the owner
of the castle.&nbsp; Edmund agreed with her, that they ought to
carry it all immediately to Mr. Hopkins, the agent. Peggy and
Anne were convinced by what Mary said, and they begged to go
along with her and their brother, to take the coins to Mr.
Hopkins.&nbsp; On their way they stopped at the vicarage, to show
the treasure to Mr. Gilbert, who took it to the young ladies,
Isabella and Caroline, and told them how it had been found.</p>
<p>It is not only by their superior riches, but it is yet more by
their superior knowledge, that persons in the higher rank of life
may assist those in a lower condition.</p>
<p>Isabella, who had some knowledge of chemistry, discovered, by
touching the coins with nitric acid, that several of them were of
gold, and consequently of great value.&nbsp; Caroline also found
out that many of the coins were very valuable as
curiosities.&nbsp; She recollected her father&rsquo;s having
shown to her the prints of the coins at the end of each
king&rsquo;s reign, in &ldquo;Rapin&rsquo;s History of
England;&rdquo; and upon comparing these impressions with the
coins found by the orphans, she perceived that many of them were
of the reign of Henry the Seventh, which, from their scarcity,
were highly appreciated by numismatic collectors.</p>
<p>Isabella and Caroline, knowing something of the character of
Mr. Hopkins, the agent, had the precaution to count the coins,
and to mark each of them with a cross, so small that it was
scarcely visible to the naked eye, though it was easily to be
seen through a magnifying glass.&nbsp; They also begged that
their father, who was well acquainted with Mr. Harvey, the
gentleman to whom Rossmore Castle belonged, to write to him, and
tell him how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure
which they had found.&nbsp; The value of the coins was estimated
at about thirty or forty guineas.</p>
<p>A few days after the fall of the chimney at Rossmore Castle,
as Mary and her sisters were sitting at their work, there came
hobbling in an old woman, leaning on a crab stick, that seemed to
have been newly cut.&nbsp; She had a broken tobacco-pipe in her
mouth; her head was wrapped up in two large red and blue
handkerchiefs, with their crooked corners hanging far down over
the back of her neck, no shoes on her broad feet, nor stockings
on her many-coloured legs.&nbsp; Her petticoat was jagged at the
bottom, and the skirt of her gown turned up over her shoulders,
to serve instead of a cloak, which she had sold for whisky.&nbsp;
This old woman was well known amongst the country people by the
name of <i>Goody Grope</i>: <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a> because she had,
for many years, been in the habit of groping in old castles, and
in moats, <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a> and at the bottom of a round tower <a
name="citation12c"></a><a href="#footnote12c"
class="citation">[12c]</a> in the neighbourhood, in search of
treasure.&nbsp; In her youth she had heard someone talking, in a
whisper, of an old prophecy, found in a bog, which said that
before many</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;St. Patrick&rsquo;s days should come
about,<br />
There would be found<br />
A treasure under ground,<br />
By one within twenty miles round.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This prophecy made a deep impression upon her.&nbsp; She also
dreamed of it three times: and as the dream, she thought, was a
sure token that the prophecy was to come true, she, from that
time forwards, gave up her spinning-wheel and her knitting, and
could think of nothing but hunting for the treasure, that was to
be found by one &ldquo;within twenty miles round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Year after year St. Patrick&rsquo;s day came about, without
her ever finding a farthing by all her groping; and as she was
always idle, she grew poorer and poorer.&nbsp; Besides, to
comfort herself for her disappointments, and to give her spirits
for fresh searches, she took to drinking.&nbsp; She sold all she
had by degrees; but still she fancied that the lucky day would
come sooner or later, <i>that would pay for all</i>.</p>
<p>Goody Grope, however, reached her sixtieth year, without ever
seeing this lucky day; and now, in her old age, she was a beggar,
without a house to shelter her, a bed to lie on, or food to put
into her mouth, but what she begged from the charity of those who
had trusted more than she had to industry and less to
<i>luck</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mary, honey! give me a potato and a sup of
something, for the love o&rsquo; mercy; for not a bit have I had
all day, except half a glass of whisky and a halfpenny worth of
tobacco!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary immediately set before her some milk, and picked a good
potato out of the bowl for her.&nbsp; She was sorry to see such
an old woman in such a wretched condition.&nbsp; Goody Grope said
she would rather have spirits of some kind or other than milk;
but Mary had no spirits to give her; so she sat herself down
close to the fire, and after she had sighed and groaned and
smoked for some time, she said to Mary, &ldquo;Well, and what
have you done with the treasure you had the luck to
find?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mary told her that she had carried it to Mr.
Hopkins, the agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I would have done in your
place,&rdquo; replied the old woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;When good luck
came to you, what a shame to turn your back upon it!&nbsp; But it
is idle talking of what&rsquo;s done&mdash;that&rsquo;s past; but
I&rsquo;ll try my luck in this here castle before next St.
Patrick&rsquo;s day comes about.&nbsp; I was told it was more
than twenty miles from our bog or I would have been here long
ago; but better late than never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was much alarmed, and not without reason, at this speech;
for she knew that if Goody Grope once set to work at the
foundation of the old castle of Rossmore, she would soon bring it
all down.&nbsp; It was in vain to talk to Goody Grope of the
danger of burying herself under the ruins, or of the
improbability of her meeting with another pot of gold
coins.&nbsp; She set her elbow upon her knees, and stopping her
ears with her hands bid Mary and her sisters not to waste their
breath advising their elders; for that, let them say what they
would, she would fall to work the next morning,
&ldquo;<i>barring</i> you&rsquo;ll make it worth my while to let
it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will make it worth your while to let it
alone?&rdquo; said Mary; for she saw that she must either get
into a quarrel or give up her habitation, or comply with the
conditions of this provoking old woman.</p>
<p>Half a crown, Goody Grope said, was the least she could be
content to take.&nbsp; Mary paid the half-crown, and was in hopes
that she had got rid for ever of her tormentor, but she was
mistaken, for scarcely was the week at an end before the old
woman appeared before her again, and repeated her threats of
falling to work the next morning, unless she had something given
to her to buy tobacco.</p>
<p>The next day and the next, and the next, Goody Grope came on
the same errand, and poor Mary, who could ill-afford to supply
her constantly with halfpence, at last exclaimed, &ldquo;I am
sure the finding of this treasure has not been any good luck to
us, but quite the contrary; and I wish we never had found
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of
this unfortunate pot of gold coins.&nbsp; Mr. Hopkins, the agent,
imagined that no one knew of the discovery of this treasure but
himself and these poor children; so, not being as honest as they
were, he resolved to keep it for his own use.&nbsp; He was
surprised some weeks afterwards to receive a letter from his
employer, Mr. Harvey, demanding from him the coins which had been
discovered at Rossmore Castle.&nbsp; Hopkins had sold the gold
coins, and some of the others; and he flattered himself that the
children, and the young ladies, to whom he now found they had
been shown, could not tell whether what they had seen were gold
or not, and he was not in the least apprehensive that those of
Henry the Seventh&rsquo;s reign should be reclaimed from him as
he thought they had escaped attention.&nbsp; So he sent over the
silver coins and others of little value, and apologized for his
not having mentioned them before, by saying that he considered
them as mere rubbish.</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey, in reply, observed that he could not consider as
rubbish the gold coins which were amongst them when they were
discovered; and he inquired why these gold coins, and those of
the reign of Henry the Seventh, were not now sent to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkins denied that he had ever received any such; but he
was thunderstruck when Mr. Harvey, in reply to this falsehood,
sent him a list of the coins which the orphans had deposited with
him, and exact drawings of those that were missing.&nbsp; He
informed him that this list and these drawings came from two
ladies who had seen the coins in question.</p>
<p>Mr. Hopkins thought that he had no means of escape but by
boldly persisting in falsehood.&nbsp; He replied, that it was
very likely such coins had been found at Rossmore Castle, and
that the ladies alluded to had probably seen them; but he
positively declared that they never came to his hands; that he
had restored all that were deposited with him; and that, as to
the others, he supposed they must have been taken out of the pot
by the children, or by Edmund or Mary on their way from the
ladies&rsquo; house to his.</p>
<p>The orphans were shocked and astonished when they heard, from
Isabella and Caroline, the charge that was made against
them.&nbsp; They looked at one another in silence for some
moments.&nbsp; Then Peggy exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Sure!&nbsp; Mr.
Hopkins has forgotten himself strangely.&nbsp; Does not he
remember Edmund&rsquo;s counting the things to him upon the great
table in his hall, and we all standing by!&nbsp; I remember it as
well as if it was this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so do I,&rdquo; cried Anne.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t you recollect, Mary, your picking out the gold ones,
and telling Mr. Hopkins that they were gold; and he said you knew
nothing of the matter; and I was going to tell him that Miss
Isabella had tried them, and knew that they were gold? but just
then there came in some tenants to pay their rent, and he pushed
us out, and twitched from my hand the piece of gold which I had
taken up to show him the bright spot which Miss Isabella had
cleaned by the stuff that she had poured on it?&nbsp; I believe
he was afraid I should steal it; he twitched it from my hand in
such a hurry.&nbsp; Do, Edmund; do, Mary&mdash;let us go to him,
and put him in mind of all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to him no more,&rdquo; said Edmund,
sturdily.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a bad man&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never go
to him again.&nbsp; Mary, don&rsquo;t be cast down&mdash;we have
no need to be cast down&mdash;we are honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mary; &ldquo;but is not it a hard
case that we, who have lived, as my mother did all her life
before us, in peace and honesty with all the world, should now
have our good name taken from us, when&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mary&rsquo;s voice faltered and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be taken from us,&rdquo; cried Edmund,
&ldquo;poor orphans though we are, and he a rich gentleman, as he
calls himself.&nbsp; Let him say and do what he will, he
can&rsquo;t hurt our good name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edmund was mistaken, alas! and Mary had but too much reason
for her fears.&nbsp; The affair was a great deal talked of; and
the agent spared no pains to have the story told his own
way.&nbsp; The orphans, conscious of their own innocence, took no
pains about the matter; and the consequence was, that all who
knew them well had no doubt of their honesty; but many, who knew
nothing of them, concluded that the agent must be in the right
and the children in the wrong.&nbsp; The buzz of scandal went on
for some time without reaching their ears, because they lived
very retiredly.&nbsp; But one day, when Mary went to sell some
stockings of Peggy&rsquo;s knitting at the neighbouring fair, the
man to whom she sold them bid her write her name on the back of a
note, and exclaimed, on seeing it&mdash;&ldquo;Ho! ho! mistress;
I&rsquo;d not have had any dealings with you, had I known your
name sooner.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the gold that you found at
Rossmore Castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in vain that Mary related the fact.&nbsp; She saw that
she gained no belief, as her character was not known to this man,
or to any of those who were present.&nbsp; She left the fair as
soon as she could; and though she struggled against it, she felt
very melancholy.&nbsp; Still she exerted herself every day at her
little manufacture; and she endeavoured to console herself by
reflecting that she had two friends left who would not give up
her character, and who continued steadily to protect her and her
sisters.</p>
<p>Isabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the
integrity of the orphans, but to prove it was in this instance
out of their power.&nbsp; Mr. Hopkins, the agent, and his
friends, constantly repeated that the gold coins were taken away
in coming from their house to his; and these ladies were blamed
by many people for continuing to countenance those that were,
with great reason, suspected to be thieves.&nbsp; The orphans
were in a worse condition than ever when the winter came on, and
their benefactresses left the country to spend some months in
Dublin.&nbsp; The old castle, it was true, was likely to last
through the winter, as the mason said; but though the want of a
comfortable house to live in was, a little while ago, the
uppermost thing in Mary&rsquo;s thoughts, now it was not so.</p>
<p>One night as Mary was going to bed, she heard someone knocking
hard at the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary, are you up? let us
in,&rdquo; cried a voice, which she knew to be the voice of Betsy
Green, the postmaster&rsquo;s daughter, who lived in the village
near them.</p>
<p>She let Betsy in, and asked what she could want at such a time
of night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me sixpence, and I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said
Betsy; &ldquo;but waken Anne and Peggy.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a
letter just come by post for you, and I stepped over to you with
it; because I guessed you&rsquo;d be glad to have it, seeing it
is your brother&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy and Anne were soon roused, when they heard that there
was a letter from Edmund.&nbsp; It was by one of his rush candles
that Mary read it; and the letter was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mary</span>, <span
class="smcap">Nancy</span>, <span class="smcap">and Little
Peg</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joy! joy!&mdash;I always said the truth would come out
at last; and that he could not take our good name from us.&nbsp;
But I will not tell you how it all came about till we meet, which
will be next week, as we are (I mean, master and mistress, and
the young ladies&mdash;bless them!&mdash;and Mr. Gilbert and I)
coming down to the vicarage to keep Christmas; and a happy
Christmas &rsquo;tis likely to be for honest folks.&nbsp; As for
they that are not honest, it is not for them to expect to be
happy, at Christmas, or any other time.&nbsp; You shall know all
when we meet.&nbsp; So, till then, fare ye well, dear Mary,
Nancy, and little Peg.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your joyful and affectionate
brother,<br />
<span class="smcap">Edmund</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To comprehend why Edmund is joyful, our readers must be
informed of certain things which happened after Isabella and
Caroline went to Dublin.&nbsp; One morning they went with their
father and mother to see the magnificent library of a nobleman,
who took generous and polite pleasure in thus sharing the
advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any
pretensions to science or literature.&nbsp; Knowing that the
gentleman who was now come to see his library was skilled in
antiquities, the nobleman opened a drawer of medals, to ask his
opinion concerning the age of some coins, which he had lately
purchased at a high price.&nbsp; They were the very same which
the orphans had found at Rossmore Castle.&nbsp; Isabella and
Caroline knew them again instantly; and as the cross which
Isabella had made on each of them was still visible through a
magnifying glass, there could be no possibility of doubt.</p>
<p>The nobleman, who was much interested both by the story of
these orphans, and the manner in which it was told to him, sent
immediately for the person from whom he had purchased the
coins.&nbsp; He was a Jew broker.&nbsp; At first he refused to
tell them from whom he got them, because he had bought them, he
said, under a promise of secrecy.&nbsp; Being further pressed, he
acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he
should not sell them to anyone in Ireland, but that he had been
tempted by the high price the present noble possessor had
offered.</p>
<p>At last, when the Jew was informed that the coins were stolen,
and that he would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen
goods, if he did not confess the whole truth, he declared that he
had purchased them from a gentleman, whom he had never seen
before or since; but he added, that he could swear to his person,
if he saw him again.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was at this time in Dublin, and
Caroline&rsquo;s father posted the Jew, the next day, in the
back-parlour of a banker&rsquo;s house, with whom Mr. Hopkins
had, on this day, appointed to settle some accounts.&nbsp; Mr.
Hopkins came&mdash;the Jew knew him&mdash;swore that he was the
man who had sold the coins to him; and thus the guilt of the
agent and the innocence of the orphans were completely
proved.</p>
<p>A full account of all that happened was sent to England to Mr.
Harvey, their landlord, and a few posts afterwards there came a
letter from him, containing a dismissal of the dishonest agent,
and a reward for the honest and industrious orphans.&nbsp; Mr.
Harvey desired that Mary and her sisters might have the slated
house, rent free, from this time forward, under the care of
ladies Isabella and Caroline, as long as Mary or her sisters
should carry on in it any useful business.&nbsp; This was the
joyful news which Edmund had to tell his sisters.</p>
<p>All the neighbours shared in their joy, and the day of their
removal from the ruins of Rossmore Castle to their new house was
the happiest of the Christmas holidays.&nbsp; They were not
envied for their prosperity; because everybody saw that it was
the reward of their good conduct; everybody except Goody
Grope.&nbsp; She exclaimed, as she wrung her hands with violent
expressions of sorrow&mdash;&ldquo;Bad luck to me! bad luck to
me!&mdash;Why didn&rsquo;t I go sooner to that there
castle?&nbsp; It is all luck, all luck in this world; but I never
had no luck.&nbsp; Think of the luck of these childer, that have
found a pot of gold, and such great, grand friends, and a slated
house, and all: and here am I, with scarce a rag to cover me, and
not a potato to put into my mouth!&mdash;I, that have been
looking under ground all my days for treasure, not to have a
halfpenny at the last, to buy me tobacco!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the very reason that you have not a
halfpenny,&rdquo; said Betsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here Mary has been
working hard, and so have her two little sisters and her brother,
for these five years past; and they have made money for
themselves by their own industry&mdash;and friends too&mdash;not
by luck, but by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phoo! phoo!&rdquo; interrupted Goody Grope;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t be prating; don&rsquo;t I know as well as you
do, that they found a pot of gold, <i>by good luck</i>? and is
not that the cause why they are going to live in a slated house
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the postmaster&rsquo;s daughter;
&ldquo;this house is given to them <i>as a reward</i>&mdash;that
was the word in the letter; for I saw it.&nbsp; Edmund showed it
to me, and will show it to anyone that wants to see.&nbsp; This
house was given to them &lsquo;<i>as a reward for their
honesty</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

LAWRENCE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the pleasant valley of Ashton
there lived an elderly woman of the name of Preston.&nbsp; She
had a small neat cottage, and there was not a weed to be seen in
her garden.&nbsp; It was upon her garden that she chiefly
depended for support; it consisted of strawberry beds, and one
small border for flowers.&nbsp; The pinks and roses she tied up
in nice nosegays, and sent either to Clifton or Bristol to be
sold.&nbsp; As to her strawberries, she did not send them to
market, because it was the custom for numbers of people to come
from Clifton, in the summer time, to eat strawberries and cream
at the gardens in Ashton.</p>
<p>Now, the widow Preston was so obliging, active and
good-humoured, that everyone who came to see her was
pleased.&nbsp; She lived happily in this manner for several
years; but, alas! one autumn she fell sick, and, during her
illness, everything went wrong; her garden was neglected, her cow
died, and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying
for medicines. The winter passed away, while she was so weak that
she could earn but little by her work; and when the summer came,
her rent was called for, and the rent was not ready in her little
purse as usual.&nbsp; She begged a few months&rsquo; delay, and
they were granted to her; but at the end of that time there was
no resource but to sell her horse Lightfoot.&nbsp; Now Lightfoot,
though perhaps he had seen his best days, was a very great
favourite. In his youth he had always carried the dame to the
market behind her husband; and it was now her little son
Jem&rsquo;s turn to ride him.&nbsp; It was Jem&rsquo;s business
to feed Lightfoot, and to take care of him&mdash;a charge which
he never neglected, for, besides being a very good natured, he
was a very industrious boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will go near to break my Jem&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo;
said Dame Preston to herself, as she sat one evening beside the
fire stirring the embers, and considering how she had best open
the matter to her son, who stood opposite to her, eating a dry
crust of bread very heartily for supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jem,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;what, ar&rsquo;t
hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am, brave and hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! no wonder, you&rsquo;ve been brave hard at
work&mdash;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave hard!&nbsp; I wish it was not so dark, mother,
that you might just step out and see the great bed I&rsquo;ve
dug; I know you&rsquo;d say it was no bad day&rsquo;s
work&mdash;and oh, mother! I&rsquo;ve good news: Farmer Truck
will give us the giant strawberries, and I&rsquo;m to go for
&rsquo;em to-morrow morning, and I&rsquo;ll be back afore
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless the boy! how he talks!&mdash;Four mile there,
and four mile back again, afore breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, upon Lightfoot, you know, mother, very easily;
mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you sigh, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish thy supper, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; cried Jem, swallowing the last
mouthful hastily, as if he thought he had been too long at
supper&mdash;&ldquo;and now for the great needle; I must see and
mend Lightfoot&rsquo;s bridle afore I go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To work he set, by the light of the fire, and the dame having
once more stirred it, began again with &ldquo;Jem, dear, does he
go lame at all now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Lightfoot!&nbsp; Oh, la, no, not he&mdash;never
was so well of his lameness in all his life.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
grown quite young again, I think, and then he&rsquo;s so fat he
can hardly wag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless him&mdash;that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; We must
see, Jem, and keep him fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Monday fortnight at the fair.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s to
be&mdash;sold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lightfoot!&rdquo; cried Jem, and let the bridle fall
from his hand; &ldquo;and <i>will</i> mother sell
Lightfoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Will</i>? no: but I <i>must</i>, Jem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must! who says you <i>must</i>? why <i>must</i> you,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must, I say, child.&nbsp; Why, must not I pay my
debts honestly; and must not I pay my rent, and was not it called
for long and long ago; and have not I had time; and did not I
promise to pay it for certain Monday fortnight, and am not I two
guineas short; and where am I to get two guineas?&nbsp; So what
signifies talking, child?&rdquo; said the widow, leaning her head
upon her arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lightfoot <i>must</i> go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem was silent for a few minutes&mdash;&ldquo;Two guineas,
that&rsquo;s a great, great deal.&nbsp; If I worked, and worked,
and worked ever so hard, I could no ways earn two guineas
<i>afore</i> Monday fortnight&mdash;could I, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord help thee, no; not an&rsquo; work thyself to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I could earn something, though, I say,&rdquo; cried
Jem, proudly; &ldquo;and I <i>will</i> earn
<i>something</i>&mdash;if it be ever so little, it will be
<i>something</i>&mdash;and I shall do my very best; so I
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;m sure of, my child,&rdquo; said his
mother, drawing him towards her and kissing him; &ldquo;you were
always a good, industrious lad, <i>that</i> I will say afore your
face or behind your back;&mdash;but it won&rsquo;t do
now&mdash;Lightfoot <i>must</i> go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem turned away struggling to hide his tears, and went to bed
without saying a word more.&nbsp; But he knew that crying would
do no good; so he presently wiped his eyes, and lay awake,
considering what he could possibly do to save the horse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I get ever so little,&rdquo; he still said to himself,
&ldquo;it will be <i>something</i>; and who knows but landlord
might then wait a bit longer? and we might make it all up in
time; for a penny a day might come to two guineas in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how to get the first penny was the question.&nbsp; Then he
recollected that one day, when he had been sent to Clifton to
sell some flowers, he had seen an old woman with a board beside
her covered with various sparkling stones, which people stopped
to look at as they passed, and he remembered that some people
bought the stones; one paid twopence, another threepence, and
another sixpence for them; and Jem heard her say that she got
them amongst the neighbouring rocks: so he thought that if he
tried he might find some too, and sell them as she had done.</p>
<p>Early in the morning he wakened full of this scheme, jumped
up, dressed himself, and, having given one look at poor Lightfoot
in his stable, set off to Clifton in search of the old woman, to
inquire where she found her sparkling stones.&nbsp; But it was
too early in the morning, the old woman was not at her seat; so
he turned back again, disappointed.&nbsp; He did not waste his
time waiting for her, but saddled and bridled Lightfoot, and went
to Farmer Truck&rsquo;s for the giant strawberries.</p>
<p>A great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the
ground; and, as soon as that was finished, he set out again in
quest of the old woman, whom, to his great joy, he spied sitting
at her corner of the street with her board before her.&nbsp; But
this old woman was deaf and cross; and when at last Jem made her
hear his questions, he could get no answer from her, but that she
found the fossils where he would never find any more.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t I look where you looked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look away, nobody hinders you,&rdquo; replied the old
woman; and these were the only words she would say.</p>
<p>Jem was not, however, a boy to be easily discouraged; he went
to the rocks, and walked slowly along, looking at all the stones
as he passed.&nbsp; Presently he came to a place where a number
of men were at work loosening some large rocks, and one amongst
the workmen was stooping down looking for something very eagerly;
Jem ran up, and asked if he could help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;you can; I&rsquo;ve
just dropped, amongst this heap of rubbish, a fine piece of
crystal that I got to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a looking thing is it?&rdquo; said
Jem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White, and like glass,&rdquo; said the man, and went on
working whilst Jem looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish
for a great while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gone for
ever; don&rsquo;t trouble yourself any more, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble; I&rsquo;ll look a little longer;
we&rsquo;ll not give it up so soon,&rdquo; said Jem; and after he
had looked a little longer, he found the piece of crystal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;e,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;you are a
fine little industrious fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem, encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke
this, ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked
the old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One good turn deserves another,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;we are going to dinner just now, and shall leave off
work&mdash;wait for me here, and I&rsquo;ll make it worth your
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem waited; and, as he was very attentively observing how the
workmen went on with their work, he heard somebody near him give
a great yawn, and, turning round, he saw stretched upon the
grass, beside the river, a boy about his own age, who, in the
village of Ashton, as he knew, went by the name of Lazy
Lawrence&mdash;a name which he most justly deserved, for he never
did anything from morning to night.&nbsp; He neither worked nor
played, but sauntered or lounged about restless and
yawning.&nbsp; His father was an ale-house keeper, and being
generally drunk, could take no care of his son; so that Lazy
Lawrence grew every day worse and worse.&nbsp; However, some of
the neighbours said that he was a good natured, poor fellow
enough, and would never do anyone harm but himself; whilst
others, who were wiser, often shook their heads, and told him
that idleness was the root of all evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Lawrence!&rdquo; cried Jem to him, when he saw
him lying upon the grass; &ldquo;what, are you asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you lie there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;because I can&rsquo;t find
anybody to play with me to-day.&nbsp; Will you come and
play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busy,&rdquo; cried Lawrence, stretching himself,
&ldquo;you are always busy.&nbsp; I would not be you for the
world, to have so much to do always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Jem, laughing, &ldquo;would not be
you for the world, to have nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They then parted, for the workman just then called Jem to
follow him.&nbsp; He took him home to his own house, and showed
him a parcel of fossils, which he had gathered, he said, on
purpose to sell, but had never had time enough to sell
them.&nbsp; Now, however, he set about the task; and having
picked out those which he judged to be the best, he put them in a
small basket, and gave them to Jem to sell, upon condition that
he should bring him half of what he got.&nbsp; Jem, pleased to be
employed, was ready to agree to what the man proposed, provided
his mother had no objection.&nbsp; When he went home to dinner,
he told his mother his scheme, and she smiled, and said he might
do as he pleased; for she was not afraid of his being from
home.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not an idle boy,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;so there is little danger of your getting into any
mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly Jem that evening took his stand, with his little
basket, upon the bank of the river, just at the place where
people land from a ferry-boat, and the walk turns to the wells,
and numbers of people perpetually pass to drink the waters.&nbsp;
He chose his place well, and waited nearly all the evening,
offering his fossils with great assiduity to every passenger; but
not one person bought any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried some sailors, who had just rowed a
boat to land, &ldquo;bear a hand here, will you, my little
fellow, and carry these parcels for us into yonder
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem ran down immediately for the parcels, and did what he was
asked to do so quickly, and with so much good-will, that the
master of the boat took notice of him, and, when he was going
away, stopped to ask him what he had got in his little basket;
and when he saw that they were fossils, he immediately told Jem
to follow him, for that he was going to carry some shells he had
brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was making
a grotto.&nbsp; &ldquo;She will very likely buy your stones into
the bargain.&nbsp; Come along, my lad; we can but try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady lived but a very little way off, so that they were
soon at her house.&nbsp; She was alone in her parlour, and was
sorting a bundle of feathers of different colours; they lay on a
sheet of pasteboard upon a window seat, and it happened that as
the sailor was bustling round the table to show off his shells,
he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard, and scattered all the
feathers.&nbsp; The lady looked very sorry, which Jem observing,
he took the opportunity, whilst she was busy looking over the
sailor&rsquo;s bag of shells, to gather together all the
feathers, and sort them according to their different colours, as
he had seen them sorted when he first came into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the little boy you brought with you?&nbsp; I
thought I saw him here just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here I am, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried Jem, creeping
from under the table, with some few remaining feathers which he
had picked from the carpet; &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; added he,
pointing to the others, &ldquo;I had better be doing something
than standing idle, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; She smiled, and,
pleased with his activity and simplicity, began to ask him
several questions; such as who he was, where he lived, what
employment he had, and how much a day he earned by gathering
fossils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first day I ever tried,&rdquo; said Jem;
&ldquo;I never sold any yet, and if you don&rsquo;t buy &rsquo;em
now, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m afraid nobody else will; for
I&rsquo;ve asked everybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said the lady, laughing, &ldquo;if
that is the case, I think I had better buy them all.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So, emptying all the fossils out of his basket, she put half a
crown into it.</p>
<p>Jem&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, thank
you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will be sure and bring
you as many more, to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t promise you,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;to give you half a crown, to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, perhaps, though you don&rsquo;t promise it, you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;do not deceive
yourself; I assure you that I will not.&nbsp; <i>That</i>,
instead of encouraging you to be industrious, would teach you to
be idle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem did not quite understand what she meant by this, but
answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t wish to be idle;
what I want is to earn something every day, if I know how;
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t wish to be idle.&nbsp; If you knew
all, you&rsquo;d know I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, <i>if I knew all</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I mean, if you knew about Lightfoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Lightfoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mammy&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; added Jem, looking out
of the window; &ldquo;I must make haste home, and feed him afore
it gets dark; he&rsquo;ll wonder what&rsquo;s gone with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him wonder a few minutes longer,&rdquo; said the
lady, &ldquo;and tell me the rest of your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no story, ma&rsquo;am, to tell, but as how
mammy says he must go to the fair Monday fortnight, to be sold,
if she can&rsquo;t get the two guineas for her rent; and I should
be main sorry to part with him, for I love him, and he loves me;
so I&rsquo;ll work for him, I will, all I can.&nbsp; To be sure,
as mammy says, I have no chance, such a little fellow as I am, of
earning two guineas afore Monday fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you willing earnestly to work?&rdquo; said the
lady; &ldquo;you know there is a great deal of difference between
picking up a few stones, and working steadily every day, and all
day long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;I would work every day,
and all day long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;I will give you
work.&nbsp; Come here, to-morrow morning, and my gardener will
set you to weed the shrubberies, and I will pay you sixpence a
day.&nbsp; Remember, you must be at the gates by six
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jem bowed, thanked her, and went
away.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening, and Jem was impatient to get home
to feed Lightfoot; yet he recollected that he had promised the
man who had trusted him to sell the fossils, that he would bring
him half of what he got for them; so he thought that he had
better go to him directly; and away he went, running along by the
waterside about a quarter of a mile, till he came to the
man&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He was just come home from work, and was
surprised when Jem showed him the half-crown, saying, &ldquo;Look
what I got for the stones; you are to have half, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man, when he had heard his story,
&ldquo;I shall not take half of that; it was given to you.&nbsp;
I expected but a shilling at the most, and the half of that is
but sixpence, and that I&rsquo;ll take.&nbsp; Wife, give the lad
two shillings, and take this half-crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the wife
opened an old glove, and took out two shillings; and the man, as
she opened the glove, put in his fingers, and took out a little
silver penny.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, he shall have that into the
bargain for his honesty&mdash;honesty is the best
policy&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lucky penny for you, that I&rsquo;ve
kept ever since I can remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever go to part with it, do ye
hear!&rdquo; cried the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him do what he will with it, wife,&rdquo; said the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; argued the wife, &ldquo;another penny would
do just as well to buy gingerbread; and that&rsquo;s what it will
go for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that it shall not, I promise you,&rdquo; said Jem;
and so he ran away home, fed Lightfoot, stroked him, went to bed,
jumped up at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and went singing
to work as gay as a lark.</p>
<p>Four days he worked &ldquo;every day and all day long&rdquo;;
and every evening the lady, when she came out to walk in her
gardens, looked at his work.&nbsp; At last she said to her
gardener, &ldquo;This little boy works very hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never had so good a little boy about the
grounds,&rdquo; said the gardener; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s always at
his work, let me come by when I will, and he has got twice as
much done as another would do; yes, twice as much, ma&rsquo;am;
for look here&mdash;he began at this &rsquo;ere rose-bush, and
now he&rsquo;s got to where you stand, ma&rsquo;am; and here is
the day&rsquo;s work that t&rsquo;other boy, and he&rsquo;s three
years older too, did to-day&mdash;I say, measure Jem&rsquo;s
fairly, and it&rsquo;s twice as much, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lady to her gardener, &ldquo;show
me how much is a fair day&rsquo;s work for a boy of his
age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come at six o&rsquo;clock and go at six? why, about
this much, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the gardener, marking off a
piece of the border with his spade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, little boy,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;so much
shall be your task every day.&nbsp; The gardener will mark it off
for you; and when you&rsquo;ve done, the rest of the day you may
do what you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem was extremely glad of this; and the next day he had
finished his task by four o&rsquo;clock; so that he had all the
rest of the evening to himself.&nbsp; He was as fond of play as
any little boy could be; and when he was at it he played with all
the eagerness and gaiety imaginable; so as soon as he had
finished his task, fed Lightfoot, and put by the sixpence he had
earned that day, he ran to the playground in the village, where
he found a party of boys playing, and amongst them Lazy Lawrence,
who indeed was not playing, but lounging upon a gate, with his
thumb in his mouth.&nbsp; The rest were playing at cricket.&nbsp;
Jem joined them, and was the merriest and most active amongst
them; till, at last, when quite out of breath with running, he
was obliged to give up to rest himself, and sat down upon the
stile, close to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was swinging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why don&rsquo;t you play, Lawrence?&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired,&rdquo; said Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know well what tires me; grandmother says
I&rsquo;m ill, and I must take something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what ails me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pugh! take a good race&mdash;one, two, three, and
away&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll find yourself as well as ever.&nbsp;
Come, run&mdash;one, two, three, and away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, I can&rsquo;t run, indeed,&rdquo; said he,
hanging back heavily; &ldquo;you know I can play all day long if
I like it, so I don&rsquo;t mind play as you do, who have only
one hour for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the worse for you.&nbsp; Come, now, I&rsquo;m
quite fresh again, will you have one game at ball? do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I tell you I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m as tired as if
I had been working all day long as hard as a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten times more,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;for I have been
working all day long, as hard as a horse, and yet you see
I&rsquo;m not a bit tired, only a little out of breath just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; said Lawrence, and
yawned, for want of some better answer; then taking out a handful
of halfpence,&mdash;&ldquo;See what I got from father to-day,
because I asked him just at the right time, when he had drunk a
glass or two; then I can get anything I want out of
him&mdash;see! a penny, twopence, threepence,
fourpence&mdash;there&rsquo;s eightpence in all; would not you be
happy if you had <i>eightpence</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Jem, laughing,
&ldquo;for you don&rsquo;t seem happy, and you <i>have
eightpence</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does not signify, though.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you
only say that because you envy me.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know
what it is to have eightpence.&nbsp; You never had more than
twopence or threepence at a time in all your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, as to that,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you are mistaken, for I have at this very time more than
twopence, threepence, or eightpence either.&nbsp; I
have&mdash;let me&mdash;see&mdash;stones, two shillings; then
five days&rsquo; work&mdash;that&rsquo;s five sixpences,
that&rsquo;s two shillings and sixpence; in all, makes four
shillings and sixpence; and my silver penny, is four and
sevenpence&mdash;four and sevenpence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not!&rdquo; said Lawrence, roused so as
absolutely to stand upright, &ldquo;four and sevenpence, have
you?&nbsp; Show it me, and then I&rsquo;ll believe
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me, then,&rdquo; cried Jem, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll soon make you believe me; come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it far?&rdquo; said Lawrence, following
half-running, half-hobbling, till he came to the stable, where
Jem showed him his treasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how did you come by
it&mdash;honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly! to be sure I did; I earned it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless me, earned it! well, I&rsquo;ve a great mind
to work; but then it&rsquo;s such hot weather, besides,
grandmother says I&rsquo;m not strong enough yet for hard work;
and besides, I know how to coax daddy out of money when I want
it, so I need not work.&nbsp; But four and sevenpence;
let&rsquo;s see, what will you do with it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; said Jem, looking
great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can guess; I know what I&rsquo;d do with it if it was
mine.&nbsp; First, I&rsquo;d buy pocketfuls of gingerbread; then
I&rsquo;d buy ever so many apples and nuts.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
love nuts?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d buy nuts enough to last me from this
time to Christmas, and I&rsquo;d make little Newton crack
&rsquo;em for me, for that&rsquo;s the worst of nuts;
there&rsquo;s the trouble of cracking &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you never deserve to have a nut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll give me some of yours,&rdquo; said
Lawrence, in a fawning tone; for he thought it easier to coax
than to work&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll give me some of your good
things, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not have any of those good things,&rdquo; said
Jem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what will you do with all your money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know very well what to do with it; but, as I told
you, that&rsquo;s a secret, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t tell it
anybody.&nbsp; Come now, let&rsquo;s go back and play&mdash;their
game&rsquo;s up, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence went back with him, full of curiosity, and out of
humour with himself and his eightpence.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had
four and sevenpence,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;I
certainly should be happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, as usual, Jem jumped up before six o&rsquo;clock
and went to his work, whilst Lazy Lawrence sauntered about
without knowing what to do with himself.&nbsp; In the course of
two days he laid out sixpence of his money in apples and
gingerbread; and as long as these lasted, he found himself well
received by his companions; but, at length the third day he spent
his last halfpenny, and when it was gone, unfortunately some nuts
tempted him very much, but he had no money to pay for them; so he
ran home to coax his father, as he called it.</p>
<p>When he got home he heard his father talking very loud, and at
first he thought he was drunk; but when he opened the kitchen
door, he saw that he was not drunk, but angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lazy dog!&rdquo; cried he, turning suddenly upon
Lawrence, and gave him such a violent box on the ear as made the
light flash from his eyes; &ldquo;you lazy dog!&nbsp; See what
you&rsquo;ve done for me&mdash;look!&mdash;look, look, I
say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses,
and with fear, amazement and remorse, beheld at least a dozen
bottles burst, and the fine Worcestershire cider streaming over
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, did not I order you three days ago to carry these
bottles to the cellar, and did not I charge you to wire the
corks? answer me, you lazy rascal; did not I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lawrence, scratching his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why was not it done, I ask you?&rdquo; cried his
father, with renewed anger, as another bottle burst at the
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you stand there for, you lazy brat?
why don&rsquo;t you move, I say?&nbsp; No, no,&rdquo; catching
hold of him, &ldquo;I believe you can&rsquo;t move; but
I&rsquo;ll make you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he shook him till Lawrence
was so giddy he could not stand.&nbsp; &ldquo;What had you to
think of?&nbsp; What had you to do all day long that you could
not carry my cider, my Worcestershire cider, to the cellar when I
bid you?&nbsp; But go, you&rsquo;ll never be good for anything;
you are such a lazy rascal&mdash;get out of my
sight!&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he pushed him out of the house
door, and Lawrence sneaked off, seeing that this was no time to
make his petition for halfpence.</p>
<p>The next day he saw the nuts again, and wishing for them more
than ever, he went home, in hopes that his father, as he said to
himself, would be in a better humour.&nbsp; But the cider was
still fresh in his recollection; and the moment Lawrence began to
whisper the word &ldquo;halfpenny&rdquo; in his ear, his father
swore, with a loud oath, &ldquo;I will not give you a halfpenny,
no, not a farthing, for a month to come.&nbsp; If you want money,
go work for it; I&rsquo;ve had enough of your laziness&mdash;go
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these terrible words Lawrence burst into tears, and, going
to the side of a ditch, sat down and cried for an hour; and when
he had cried till he could cry no more, he exerted himself so far
as to empty his pockets, to see whether there might not happen to
be one halfpenny left; and, to his great joy, in the farthest
corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found.&nbsp; With this he
proceeded to the fruit woman&rsquo;s stall.&nbsp; She was busy
weighing out some plums, so he was obliged to wait; and whilst he
was waiting he heard some people near him talking and laughing
very loud.</p>
<p>The fruit woman&rsquo;s stall was at the gate of an inn yard;
and peeping through the gate in this yard, Lawrence saw a
postilion and a stable boy, about his own size, playing at pitch
farthing.&nbsp; He stood by watching them for a few
minutes.&nbsp; &ldquo;I began but with one halfpenny,&rdquo;
cried the stable boy, with an oath, &ldquo;and now I&rsquo;ve got
twopence!&rdquo; added he, jingling the halfpence in his
waistcoat pocket.&nbsp; Lawrence was moved at the sound, and said
to himself, &ldquo;If <i>I</i> begin with one halfpenny I may
end, like him, with having twopence; and it is easier to play at
pitch farthing than to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he stepped forward, presenting his halfpenny, offering to
toss up with the stable boy, who, after looking him full in the
face, accepted the proposal, and threw his halfpenny into the
air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Head or tail?&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Head,&rdquo; replied Lawrence, and it came up head.&nbsp;
He seized the penny, surprised at his own success, and would have
gone instantly to have laid it out in nuts; but the stable boy
stopped him, and tempted him to throw again.&nbsp; This time
Lawrence lost; he threw again and won; and so he went on,
sometimes losing, but most frequently winning, till half the
morning was lost.&nbsp; At last, however, finding himself the
master of three halfpence, said he would play no more.</p>
<p>The stable boy, grumbling, swore he would have his revenge
another time, and Lawrence went and bought his nuts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a good thing,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;to
play at pitch farthing; the next time I want a halfpenny
I&rsquo;ll not ask my father for it, nor go to work
neither.&rdquo;&nbsp; Satisfied with this resolution, he sat down
to crack his nuts at his leisure, upon the horse block in the inn
yard.&nbsp; Here, whilst he ate, he overheard the conversation of
the stable boys and postilions.&nbsp; At first their shocking
oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him; for
Lawrence, though lazy, had not yet learned to be a wicked
boy.&nbsp; But, by degrees, he was accustomed to the swearing and
quarrelling, and took a delight and interest in their disputes
and battles.&nbsp; As this was an amusement which he could enjoy
without any sort of exertion, he soon grew so fond of it, that
every day he returned to the stable yard, and the horse block
became his constant seat.&nbsp; Here he found some relief from
the insupportable fatigue of doing nothing, and here, hour after
hour, with his elbows on his knees, and his head on his hands, he
sat, the spectator of wickedness.&nbsp; Gaming, cheating and
lying soon became familiar to him; and, to complete his ruin, he
formed a sudden and close intimacy with the stable boy (a very
bad boy) with whom he had first begun to game.</p>
<p>The consequences of this intimacy we shall presently
see.&nbsp; But it is now time to inquire what little Jem had been
doing all this while.</p>
<p>One day, after Jem had finished his task, the gardener asked
him to stay a little while, to help him to carry some geranium
pots into the hall.&nbsp; Jem, always active and obliging,
readily stayed from play, and was carrying in a heavy flower pot,
when his mistress crossed the hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a terrible
litter!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are making here&mdash;why
don&rsquo;t you wipe your shoes upon the mat?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jem
turned to look for the mat, but he saw none.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the lady recollecting herself, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t blame you, for there is no mat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the gardener, &ldquo;nor I
don&rsquo;t know when, if ever, the man will bring home those
mats you bespoke, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to hear that,&rdquo; said the lady;
&ldquo;I wish we could find somebody who would do them, if he
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I should not care what sort of mats they were,
so that one could wipe one&rsquo;s feet on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jem, as he was sweeping away the litter, when he heard these
last words, said to himself, &ldquo;Perhaps I could make a
mat.&rdquo;&nbsp; And all the way home, as he trudged along
whistling, he was thinking over a scheme for making mats, which,
however bold it may appear, he did not despair of executing, with
patience and industry.&nbsp; Many were the difficulties which his
&ldquo;prophetic eye&rdquo; foresaw; but he felt within himself
that spirit which spurs men on to great enterprises, and makes
them &ldquo;trample on impossibilities.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the first
place, he recollected that he had seen Lazy Lawrence, whilst he
lounged upon the gate, twist a bit of heath into different
shapes; and he thought, that if he could find some way of
plaiting heath firmly together, it would make a very pretty green
soft mat, which would do very well for one to wipe one&rsquo;s
shoes on.&nbsp; About a mile from his mother&rsquo;s house, on
the common which Jem rode over when he went to Farmer
Truck&rsquo;s for the giant strawberries, he remembered to have
seen a great quantity of this heath; and, as it was now only six
o&rsquo;clock in the evening, he knew that he should have time to
feed Lightfoot, stroke him, go to the common, return, and make
one trial of his skill before he went to bed.</p>
<p>Lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common, and there Jem
gathered as much of the heath as he thought he should want.&nbsp;
But what toil! what time! what pains did it cost him, before he
could make anything like a mat!&nbsp; Twenty times he was ready
to throw aside the heath, and give up his project, from
impatience of repeated disappointments.&nbsp; But still he
persevered.&nbsp; Nothing <i>truly great</i> can be accomplished
without toil and time.&nbsp; Two hours he worked before he went
to bed.&nbsp; All his play hours the next day he spent at his
mat; which, in all, made five hours of fruitless attempts.&nbsp;
The sixth, however, repaid him for the labours of the other
five.&nbsp; He conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the
heath substantially together, and at length completely finished a
mat, which far surpassed his most sanguine expectations.&nbsp; He
was extremely happy&mdash;sang, danced round
it&mdash;whistled&mdash;looked at it again and again, and could
hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to
bed.&nbsp; He laid it by his bedside, that he might see it the
moment he awoke in the morning.</p>
<p>And now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his
mistress.&nbsp; She looked fully as much surprised as he
expected, when she saw it, and when she heard who made it.&nbsp;
After having duly admired it, she asked how much he expected for
his mat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Expect!&mdash;Nothing, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said Jem; &ldquo;I meant to give it you, if you&rsquo;d have it;
I did not mean to sell it.&nbsp; I made it in my play hours, I
was very happy in making it; and I&rsquo;m very glad, too, that
you like it; and if you please to keep it, ma&rsquo;am,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not all,&rdquo; said the lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Spend your time no more in weeding in my garden, you can
employ yourself much better; you shall have the reward of your
ingenuity as well as of your industry.&nbsp; Make as many more
such mats as you can, and I will take care and dispose of them
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;e, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Jem, making his
best bow, for he thought by the lady&rsquo;s looks that she meant
to do him a favour, though he repeated to himself, &ldquo;Dispose
of them, what does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day he went to work to make more mats, and he soon
learned to make them so well and quickly, that he was surprised
at his own success.&nbsp; In every one he made he found less
difficulty, so that, instead of making two, he could soon make
four in a day.&nbsp; In a fortnight he made eighteen.</p>
<p>It was Saturday night when he finished, and he carried, at
three journeys, his eighteen mats to his mistress&rsquo; house;
piled them all up in the hall, and stood with his hat off, with a
look of proud humility, beside the pile, waiting for his
mistress&rsquo; appearance.&nbsp; Presently a folding-door, at
one end of the hall, opened, and he saw his mistress, with a
great many gentlemen and ladies, rising from several tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there is my little boy and his mats,&rdquo; cried
the lady; and, followed by all the rest of the company, she came
into the hall.&nbsp; Jem modestly retired whilst they looked at
his mats; but in a minute or two his mistress beckoned to him,
and when he came into the middle of the circle, he saw that his
pile of mats had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lady, smiling, &ldquo;what do you
see that makes you look so surprised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all my mats are gone,&rdquo; said Jem; &ldquo;but
you are very welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we?&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;well, take up your
hat and go home then, for you see that it is getting late, and
you know Lightfoot will wonder what&rsquo;s become of
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jem turned round to take up his hat, which he
had left on the floor.</p>
<p>But how his countenance changed! the hat was heavy with
shillings.&nbsp; Everyone who had taken a mat had put in two
shillings; so that for the eighteen mats he had got thirty-six
shillings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thirty-six shillings,&rdquo; said the
lady; &ldquo;five and sevenpence I think you told me you had
earned already&mdash;how much does that make?&nbsp; I must add, I
believe, one other sixpence to make out your two
guineas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two guineas!&rdquo; exclaimed Jem, now quite conquering
his bashfulness, for at the moment he forgot where he was, and
saw nobody that was by.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two guineas!&rdquo; cried
he, clapping his hands together,&mdash;&ldquo;O, Lightfoot!&nbsp;
O, mother!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, recollecting himself, he saw his
mistress, whom he now looked up to quite as a friend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will <i>you</i> thank them all?&rdquo; said he, scarcely
daring to glance his eyes round upon the company; &ldquo;will
<i>you</i> thank &rsquo;em, for you know I don&rsquo;t know how
to thank &rsquo;em <i>rightly</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everybody
thought, however, that they had been thanked <i>rightly</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we won&rsquo;t keep you any longer, only,&rdquo;
said his mistress, &ldquo;I have one thing to ask you, that I may
be by when you show your treasure to your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;come with me
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said the lady, laughing; &ldquo;but I
will come to Ashton to-morrow evening; perhaps your mother can
find me a few strawberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she will,&rdquo; said Jem: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
search the garden myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now went home, but felt it a great restraint to wait till
to-morrow evening before he told his mother.&nbsp; To console
himself he flew to the stable:&mdash;&ldquo;Lightfoot,
you&rsquo;re not to be sold on Monday, poor fellow!&rdquo; said
he, patting him, and then could not refrain from counting out his
money.&nbsp; Whilst he was intent upon this, Jem was startled by
a noise at the door: somebody was trying to pull up the
latch.&nbsp; It opened, and there came in Lazy Lawrence, with a
boy in a red jacket, who had a cock under his arm.&nbsp; They
started when they got into the middle of the stable, and when
they saw Jem, who had been at first hidden by the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&mdash;we came,&rdquo; stammered Lazy
Lawrence&mdash;&ldquo;I mean, I came
to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To ask you,&rdquo; continued the stable-boy, in a bold
tone, &ldquo;whether you will go with us to the cock-fight on
Monday?&nbsp; See, I&rsquo;ve a fine cock here, and Lawrence told
me you were a great friend of his; so I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the
pleasures of cock-fighting and in recommendation of his new
companion.&nbsp; But Jem looked at the stable-boy with dislike,
and a sort of dread.&nbsp; Then turning his eyes upon the cock
with a look of compassion, said, in a low voice, to Lawrence,
&ldquo;Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Lawrence, &ldquo;as to
that; but they say a cockfight&rsquo;s a fine sight, and
it&rsquo;s no more cruel in me to go than another; and a great
many go, and I&rsquo;ve nothing else to do, so I shall
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have something else to do,&rdquo; said Jem,
laughing, &ldquo;so I shall not go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Lawrence, &ldquo;you know Monday
is the great Bristol fair, and one must be merry then, of all the
days in the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day in the year, sure, there&rsquo;s no harm in
being merry,&rdquo; said the stable boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Jem; &ldquo;for I know for my
part, I am merry every day in the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; said Lawrence; &ldquo;but
I know for my part, I would not for all the world miss going to
the fair, for at least it will be something to talk of for half a
year after.&nbsp; Come, you&rsquo;ll go, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jem, still looking as if he did not
like to talk before the ill-looking stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what will you do with all your money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about that another time,&rdquo;
whispered Jem; &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you go to see that
cock&rsquo;s eyes pecked out; it won&rsquo;t make you merry,
I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had anything else to divert me,&rdquo; said
Lawrence, hesitating and yawning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried the stable boy, seizing his
stretching arm, &ldquo;come along,&rdquo; cried he; and, pulling
him away from Jem, upon whom he cast a look of extreme contempt;
&ldquo;leave him alone, he&rsquo;s not the sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool you are,&rdquo; said he to Lawrence, the
moment he got him out of the stable; &ldquo;you might have known
he would not go, else we should soon have trimmed him out of his
four and sevenpence.&nbsp; But how came you to talk of four and
sevenpence.&nbsp; I saw in the manger a hat full of
silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed; but why did you stammer so when we first
got in?&nbsp; You had liked to have blown us all up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so ashamed,&rdquo; said Lawrence, hanging down
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashamed! but you must not talk of shame now you are in
for it, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t let you off; you owe us half a
crown, recollect, and I must be paid to-night, so see and get the
money somehow or other.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a considerable pause
he added, &ldquo;I answer for it he&rsquo;d never miss half a
crown out of all that silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to steal,&rdquo; said Lawrence, drawing back with
horror, &ldquo;I never thought I should come to that&mdash;and
from poor Jem, too&mdash;the money that he has worked so hard
for, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not stealing; we don&rsquo;t mean to steal;
only to borrow it; and if we win, which we certainly shall, at
the cock-fight, pay it back again, and he&rsquo;ll never know
anything about the matter, and what harm will it do him?&nbsp;
Besides, what signifies talking, you can&rsquo;t go to the
cock-fight, or the fair either, if you don&rsquo;t; and I tell ye
we don&rsquo;t mean to steal it; we&rsquo;ll pay it by Monday
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence made no reply, and they parted without his coming to
any determination.</p>
<p>Here let us pause in our story.&nbsp; We are almost afraid to
go on.&nbsp; The rest is very shocking.&nbsp; Our little readers
will shudder as they read.&nbsp; But it is better that they
should know the truth, and see what the idle boy came to at
last.</p>
<p>In the dead of the night, Lawrence heard somebody tap at his
window.&nbsp; He knew well who it was, for this was the signal
agreed upon between him and his wicked companion.&nbsp; He
trembled at the thoughts of what he was about to do, and lay
quite still, with his head under the bedclothes, till he heard
the second tap.&nbsp; Then he got up, dressed himself, and opened
his window.&nbsp; It was almost even with the ground.&nbsp; His
companion said to him, in a hollow voice, &ldquo;Are you
ready?&rdquo;&nbsp; He made no answer, but got out of the window
and followed.</p>
<p>When he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over
the moon, and it was quite dark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are
you?&rdquo; whispered Lawrence, groping about, &ldquo;where are
you?&nbsp; Speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here; give me your hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lawrence
stretched out his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that your hand?&rdquo;
said the wicked boy, as Lawrence laid hold of him; &ldquo;how
cold it feels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go back,&rdquo; said Lawrence; &ldquo;it is time
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no time to go back,&rdquo; replied the other,
opening the door; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve gone too far now to go
back,&rdquo; and he pushed Lawrence into the stable.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you found it?&nbsp; Take care of the horse.&nbsp;
Have you done?&nbsp; What are you about?&nbsp; Make haste, I hear
a noise,&rdquo; said the stable boy, who watched at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am feeling for the half-crown, but I can&rsquo;t find
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring all together.&rdquo;&nbsp; He brought Jem&rsquo;s
broken flower pot, with all the money in it, to the door.&nbsp;
The black cloud had now passed over the moon, and the light shone
full upon them.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do we stand here for?&rdquo;
said the stable boy, snatching the flower-pot out of
Lawrence&rsquo;s trembling hands, and pulled him away from the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Lawrence, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t
take all.&nbsp; You said you&rsquo;d only take half a crown, and
pay it back on Monday.&nbsp; You said you&rsquo;d only take half
a crown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; replied the other, walking on,
deaf to all remonstrances&mdash;&ldquo;if ever I am to be hanged,
it sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be for half a crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence&rsquo;s blood ran cold in his veins, and he felt as
if all his hair stood on end.&nbsp; Not another word
passed.&nbsp; His accomplice carried off the money, and Lawrence
crept, with all the horrors of guilt upon him, to his restless
bed.&nbsp; All night he was starting from frightful dreams; or
else, broad awake, he lay listening to every small noise, unable
to stir, and scarcely daring to breathe&mdash;tormented by that
most dreadful of all kinds of fear, that fear which is the
constant companion of an evil conscience.</p>
<p>He thought the morning would never come; but when it was day,
when he heard the birds sing, and saw everything look cheerful as
usual, he felt still more miserable.&nbsp; It was Sunday morning,
and the bell rang for church.&nbsp; All the children of the
village, dressed in their Sunday clothes, innocent and gay, and
little Jem, the best and gayest amongst them, went flocking by
his door to church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Lawrence,&rdquo; said Jem, pulling his coat as he
passed and saw Lawrence leaning against his father&rsquo;s door,
&ldquo;what makes you look so black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Lawrence, starting; &ldquo;why do you
say that I look black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;you look white
enough now, if that will please you, for you&rsquo;re turned as
pale as death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pale?&rdquo; replied Lawrence, not knowing what he
said, and turned abruptly away, for he dared not stand another
look of Jem&rsquo;s; conscious that guilt was written in his
face, he shunned every eye.&nbsp; He would now have given the
world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his
mind.&nbsp; He longed to follow Jem, to fall upon his knees and
confess all.</p>
<p>Dreading the moment when Jem should discover his loss,
Lawrence dared not stay at home, and not knowing what to do, or
where to go, he mechanically went to his old haunt at the stable
yard, and lurked thereabouts all day with his accomplice, who
tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his spirits by talking
of the next day&rsquo;s cock-fight.&nbsp; It was agreed that as
soon as the dusk of the evening came on, they should go together
into a certain lonely field, and there divide their booty.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jem, when he returned from church, was very
full of business, preparing for the reception of his mistress, of
whose intended visit he had informed his mother; and whilst she
was arranging the kitchen and their little parlour, he ran to
search the strawberry beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my Jem, how merry you are to-day!&rdquo; said his
mother, when he came in with the strawberries, and was jumping
about the room playfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, keep those spirits of
yours, Jem, till you want &rsquo;em, and don&rsquo;t let it come
upon you all at once.&nbsp; Have it in mind that
to-morrow&rsquo;s fair day, and Lightfoot must go.&nbsp; I bid
Farmer Truck call for him to-night.&nbsp; He said he&rsquo;d take
him along with his own, and he&rsquo;ll be here just
now&mdash;and then I know how it will be with you,
Jem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; cried Jem, swallowing his secret with
great difficulty, and then tumbling head over heels four times
running.</p>
<p>A carriage passed the window, and stopped at the door.&nbsp;
Jem ran out; it was his mistress.&nbsp; She came in smiling, and
soon made the old woman smile, too, by praising the neatness of
everything in the house.</p>
<p>We shall pass over, however important as they were deemed at
the time, the praises of the strawberries, and of &ldquo;my
grandmother&rsquo;s china plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another knock was heard at the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Run,
Jem,&rdquo; said his mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s our
milk-woman with cream for the lady.&rdquo;&nbsp; No; it was
Farmer Truck come for Lightfoot.&nbsp; The old woman&rsquo;s
countenance fell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fetch him out, dear,&rdquo; said
she, turning to her son; but Jem was gone; he flew out to the
stable the moment he saw the flap of Farmer Truck&rsquo;s
great-coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit ye down, farmer,&rdquo; said the old woman, after
they had waited about five minutes in expectation of Jem&rsquo;s
return.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best sit down, if the lady will
give you leave; for he&rsquo;ll not hurry himself back
again.&nbsp; My boy&rsquo;s a fool, madam, about that there
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Trying to laugh, she added, &ldquo;I knew how
Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part.&nbsp; He
won&rsquo;t bring him out till the last minute; so do sit ye
down, neighbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer had scarcely sat down when Jem, with a pale, wild
countenance came back.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo; said his mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;God bless the
boy!&rdquo; said his mother, looking at him quite frightened,
whilst he tried to speak, but could not.</p>
<p>She went up to him, and then leaning his head against her, he
cried, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&mdash;it&rsquo;s all gone!&rdquo;
and, bursting into tears, he sobbed as if his little heart would
break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s gone, love?&rdquo; said his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My two guineas&mdash;Lightfoot&rsquo;s two
guineas.&nbsp; I went to fetch &rsquo;em to give you, mammy; but
the broken flower-pot that I put them in, and all&rsquo;s
gone!&mdash;quite gone!&rdquo; repeated he, checking his
sobs.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw them safe last night, and was showing
&rsquo;em to Lightfoot; and I was so glad to think I had earned
them all myself; and I thought how surprised you&rsquo;d look,
and how glad you&rsquo;d be, and how you&rsquo;d kiss me, and
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother listened to him with the greatest surprise, whilst
his mistress stood in silence, looking first at the old woman,
and then at Jem with a penetrating eye, as if she suspected the
truth of his story, and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her
own compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very strange thing!&rdquo; said she,
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;How came you to leave all your money in a
broken flower-pot in the stable?&nbsp; How came you not to give
it to your mother to take care of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo; said Jem, looking
up, in the midst of his tears&mdash;&ldquo;why, don&rsquo;t you
remember you, your own self, bid me not tell her about it till
you were by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you not tell her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, ask mammy,&rdquo; said Jem, a little offended; and
when afterwards the lady went on questioning him in a severe
manner, as if she did not believe him, he at last made no
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jem! Jem! why don&rsquo;t you speak to the
lady?&rdquo; said his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoke, and spoke the truth,&rdquo; said Jem,
proudly; &ldquo;and she did not believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the lady, who had lived too long in the world to be
without suspicion, maintained a cold manner, and determined to
wait the event without interfering, saying only, that she hoped
the money would be found, and advised Jem to have done
crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done,&rdquo; said Jem; &ldquo;I shall cry no
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he had the greatest command over
himself, he actually did not shed another tear, not even when the
farmer got up to go, saying, he could wait no longer.</p>
<p>Jem silently went to bring out Lightfoot.&nbsp; The lady now
took her seat, where she could see all that passed at the open
parlour-window.&nbsp; The old woman stood at the door, and
several idle people of the village, who had gathered round the
lady&rsquo;s carriage examining it, turned about to listen.&nbsp;
In a minute or two Jem appeared, with a steady countenance,
leading Lightfoot and, when he came up, without saying a word,
put the bridle into Farmer Truck&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>has been</i> a good horse,&rdquo; said the
farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> a good horse!&rdquo; cried Jem, and threw
his arm over Lightfoot&rsquo;s neck, hiding his own face as he
leaned upon him.</p>
<p>At this instant a party of milk-women went by; and one of
them, having set down her pail, came behind Jem, and gave him a
pretty smart blow upon the back.&nbsp; He looked up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forget,&rdquo; said Jem; &ldquo;I think I have seen
your face before, but I forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you so? and you&rsquo;ll tell me just now,&rdquo;
said she, half opening her hand, &ldquo;that you forget who gave
you this, and who charged you not to part with it,
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here she quite opened her large hand, and on
the palm of it appeared Jem&rsquo;s silver penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; exclaimed Jem, seizing it, &ldquo;oh,
where did you find it? and have you&mdash;oh, tell me, have you
got the rest of my money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of your money&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what you would be at,&rdquo; said the milk-woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&mdash;pray tell me where&mdash;did you find
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With them that you gave it to, I suppose,&rdquo; said
the milk-woman, turning away suddenly to take up her
milk-pail.&nbsp; But now Jem&rsquo;s mistress called to her
through the window, begging her to stop, and joining in his
entreaties to know how she came by the silver penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; said she, taking up the corner of
her apron, &ldquo;I came by it in an odd way, too.&nbsp; You must
know my Betty is sick, so I came with the milk myself, though
it&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m used to; for my Betty&mdash;you
know my Betty?&rdquo; said she, turning round to the old woman,
&ldquo;my Betty serves you, and she&rsquo;s a tight and stirring
lassy, ma&rsquo;am, I can assure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; said the lady,
impatiently; &ldquo;but about the silver penny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s true; as I was coming along all
alone, for the rest came round, and I came a short cut across yon
field&mdash;no, you can&rsquo;t see it, madam, where you
stand&mdash;but if you were here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it&mdash;I know it,&rdquo; said Jem, out of
breath with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;I rested my pail upon the stile,
and sets me down awhile, and there comes out of the hedge&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know well how, for they startled me so I&rsquo;d
liked to have thrown down my milk&mdash;two boys, one about the
size of he,&rdquo; said she pointing to Jem, &ldquo;and one a
matter taller, but ill-looking like; so I did not think to stir
to make way for them, and they were like in a desperate hurry:
so, without waiting for the stile, one of &rsquo;em pulled at the
gate, and when it would not open (for it was tied with a pretty
stout cord) one of &rsquo;em whips out with his knife and cuts
it&mdash;&nbsp; Now, have you a knife about you, sir?&rdquo;
continued the milk woman to the farmer.&nbsp; He gave her his
knife.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, now, ma&rsquo;am, just sticking, as it
were here, between the blade and the haft, was the silver
penny.&nbsp; The lad took no notice; but when he opened it, out
it falls.&nbsp; Still he takes no heed, but cuts the cord, as I
said before, and through the gate they went, and out of sight in
half a minute.&nbsp; I picks up the penny, for my heart misgave
me that it was the very one husband had had a long time, and had
given against my voice to he,&rdquo; pointing to Jem; &ldquo;and
I charged him not to part with it; and, ma&rsquo;am, when I
looked I knew it by the mark, so I thought I would show it to
<i>he</i>,&rdquo; again pointing to Jem, &ldquo;and let him give
it back to those it belongs to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belongs to me,&rdquo; said Jem, &ldquo;I never gave
it to anybody&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried the farmer, &ldquo;those boys have
robbed him; it is they who have all his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, which way did they go?&rdquo; cried Jem,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the lady, calling to her servant;
and she desired him to take his horse and ride after them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; added Farmer Truck, &ldquo;do you take the
road, and I&rsquo;ll take the field way, and I&rsquo;ll be bound
we&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;em presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves, the lady, who
was now thoroughly convinced of Jem&rsquo;s truth, desired her
coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him
that evening.&nbsp; Out of the boot of the carriage the coachman
immediately produced a new saddle and bridle.</p>
<p>How Jem&rsquo;s eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon
Lightfoot&rsquo;s back!&nbsp; &ldquo;Put it on your horse
yourself, Jem,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;it is
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Confused reports of Lightfoot&rsquo;s splendid accoutrements,
of the pursuit of thieves, and of the fine and generous lady who
was standing at Dame Preston&rsquo;s window, quickly spread
through the village, and drew everybody from their houses.&nbsp;
They crowded round Jem to hear the story.&nbsp; The children
especially, who were fond of him, expressed the strongest
indignation against the thieves.&nbsp; Every eye was on the
stretch; and now some, who had run down the lane, came back
shouting, &ldquo;Here they are! they&rsquo;ve got the
thieves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footman on horseback carried one boy before him; and the
farmer, striding along, dragged another.&nbsp; The latter had on
a red jacket, which little Jem immediately recollected, and
scarcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on
horseback.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said he to himself,
&ldquo;it must be&mdash;yet surely it can&rsquo;t be
Lawrence!&rdquo;&nbsp; The footman rode on as fast as the people
would let him.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s hat was slouched, and his
head hung down, so that nobody could see his face.</p>
<p>At this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd.&nbsp; A
man who was half drunk pushed his way forwards, swearing that
nobody should stop him; that he had a right to see&mdash;and he
<i>would</i> see.&nbsp; And so he did; for, forcing through all
resistance, he staggered up to the footman just as he was lifting
down the boy he had carried before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
<i>will</i>&mdash;I tell you I <i>will</i> see the thief!&rdquo;
cried the drunken man, pushing up the boy&rsquo;s hat.&nbsp; It
was his own son.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lawrence!&rdquo; exclaimed the
wretched father.&nbsp; The shock sobered him at once, and he hid
his face in his hands.</p>
<p>There was an awful silence.&nbsp; Lawrence fell on his knees,
and in a voice that could scarcely be heard made a full
confession of all the circumstances of his guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a young creature so wicked!&rdquo; the bystanders
exclaimed; &ldquo;what could put such wickedness in your
head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad company,&rdquo; said Lawrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came you&mdash;what brought you into bad
company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, except it was idleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy
Lawrence&rsquo;s pockets; and when the money appeared, all his
former companions in the village looked at each other with
astonishment and terror.&nbsp; Their parents grasped their little
hands closer, and cried, &ldquo;Thank God! he is not my
son.&nbsp; How often when he was little we used, as he lounged
about, to tell him that idleness was the root of all
evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the hardened wretch, his accomplice, everyone was
impatient to have him sent to gaol.&nbsp; He put on a bold,
insolent countenance, till he heard Lawrence&rsquo;s confession;
till the money was found upon him; and he heard the milk-woman
declare that she would swear to the silver penny which he had
dropped.&nbsp; Then he turned pale, and betrayed the strongest
signs of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take him before the justice,&rdquo; said the
farmer, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll be lodged in Bristol
gaol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jem, springing forwards when
Lawrence&rsquo;s hands were going to be tied, &ldquo;let him
go&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&mdash;can&rsquo;t you let him
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam, for mercy&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said
Jem&rsquo;s mother to the lady, &ldquo;think what a disgrace to
his family to be sent to gaol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of
despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault,&rdquo; cried he;
&ldquo;I brought him up in idleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll never be idle any more,&rdquo; said
Jem; &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you speak for him,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask the lady to speak for him,&rdquo; said
the farmer; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better he should go to Bridewell
now, than to the gallows by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said; for everybody felt the truth of the
farmer&rsquo;s speech.</p>
<p>Lawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month, and the
stable-boy was sent for trial, convicted, and transported to
Botany Bay.</p>
<p>During Lawrence&rsquo;s confinement, Jem often visited him,
and carried him such little presents as he could afford to give;
and Jem could afford to be <i>generous</i>, because he was
<i>industrious</i>.&nbsp; Lawrence&rsquo;s heart was touched by
his kindness, and his example struck him so forcibly that, when
his confinement was ended, he resolved to set immediately to
work; and, to the astonishment of all who knew him, soon became
remarkable for industry.&nbsp; He was found early and late at his
work, established a new character, and for ever lost the name of
&ldquo;<i>Lazy Lawrence</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>THE
FALSE KEY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Spencer</span>, a very benevolent and
sensible man, undertook the education of several poor
children.&nbsp; Among the rest was a boy of the name of Franklin,
whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old.&nbsp;
Franklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous
character; and for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to
his child.&nbsp; When any of the neighbours&rsquo; children
quarrelled with him, they used to tell him that he would turn out
like his father.&nbsp; But Mr. Spencer always assured him that he
might make himself whatever he pleased; that by behaving well he
would certainly, sooner or later, secure the esteem and love of
all who knew him, even of those who had the strongest prejudice
against him on his father&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>This hope was very delightful to Franklin, and he showed the
strongest desire to learn and to do everything that was right; so
that Mr. Spencer soon grew fond of him, and took great pains to
instruct him, and to give him all the good habits and principles
which might make him a useful, respectable and happy man.</p>
<p>When he was about thirteen years of age, Mr. Spencer one day
sent for him into his closet; and as he was folding up a letter
which he had been writing, said to him, with a very kind look,
but in a graver tone than usual, &ldquo;Franklin, you are going
to leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Franklin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are now going to leave me, and to begin the world
for yourself.&nbsp; You will carry this letter to my sister, Mrs.
Churchill, in Queen&rsquo;s Square.&nbsp; You know Queen&rsquo;s
Square?&rdquo;&nbsp; Franklin bowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must
expect,&rdquo; continued Mr. Spencer, &ldquo;to meet with several
disagreeable things, and a great deal of rough work, at your
first setting out; but be faithful and obedient to your mistress,
and obliging to your fellow-servants, and all will go well.&nbsp;
Mrs. Churchill will make you a very good mistress, if you behave
properly; and I have no doubt but you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will always&mdash;I mean, as long as you
deserve it&mdash;find a friend in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir&mdash;I am sure you
are&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; There Franklin stopped short, for the
recollection of all Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s goodness rushed upon him
at once, and he could not say another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a candle to seal this letter,&rdquo; said his
master; and he was very glad to get out of the room.&nbsp; He
came back with the candle, and, with a stout heart, stood by
whilst the letter was sealing; and, when his master put it into
his hand, said, in a cheerful voice, &ldquo;I hope you will let
me see you again, sir, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; whenever your mistress can spare you, I
shall be very glad to see you; and remember, if ever you get into
any difficulty, don&rsquo;t be afraid to come to me.&nbsp; I have
sometimes spoken harshly to you; but you will not meet with a
more indulgent friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; Franklin at this turned away
with a full heart; and, after making two or three attempts to
express his gratitude, left the room without being able to
speak.</p>
<p>He got to Queen&rsquo;s Square about three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The door was opened by a large, red-faced
man, in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat, to whom he felt afraid
to give his message, lest he should not be a servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s your business, sir?&rdquo; said the
butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a letter for Mrs. Churchill, sir,&rdquo; said
Franklin, endeavouring to pronounce his &ldquo;sir&rdquo; in a
tone as respectful as the butler&rsquo;s was insolent.</p>
<p>The man having examined the direction, seal, and edges of the
letter, carried it upstairs, and in a few minutes returned, and
ordered Franklin to rub his shoes well and follow him.&nbsp; He
was then shown into a handsome room, where he found his
mistress&mdash;an elderly lady.&nbsp; She asked him a few
questions, examining him attentively as she spoke; and her severe
eye at first, and her gracious smile afterwards, made him feel
that she was a person to be both loved and feared.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall give you in charge,&rdquo; said she, ringing a bell,
&ldquo;to my housekeeper, and I hope she will have no reason to
be displeased with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper, when she first came in, appeared with a
smiling countenance; but the moment she cast her eyes on
Franklin, it changed to a look of surprise and suspicion.&nbsp;
Her mistress recommended him to her protection, saying,
&ldquo;Pomfret, I hope you will keep this boy under your own
eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she received him with a cold &ldquo;Very
well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; which plainly showed that she was not
disposed to like him.&nbsp; In fact, Mrs. Pomfret was a woman so
fond of power, and so jealous of favour, that she would have
quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress without
her introduction.&nbsp; She smothered her displeasure, however,
till night; when, as she attended her mistress&rsquo; toilette,
she could not refrain from expressing her sentiments.&nbsp; She
began cautiously: &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, is not this the boy Mr.
Spencer was talking of one day&mdash;that has been brought up by
the <i>Villaintropic Society</i>, I think they call
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philanthropic Society; yes,&rdquo; said her mistress;
&ldquo;and my brother gives him a high character: I hope he will
do very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so too,&rdquo; observed Mrs.
Pomfret; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t say; for my part, I&rsquo;ve no
great notion of those low people.&nbsp; They say all those
children are taken from the very lowest <i>drugs</i> and
<i>refuges</i> of the town, and surely they are like enough,
ma&rsquo;am, to take after their own fathers and
mothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are not suffered to be with their
parents,&rdquo; rejoined the lady; &ldquo;and therefore cannot be
hurt by their example.&nbsp; This little boy, to be sure, was
unfortunate in his father, but he has had an excellent
education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>edication</i>! to be sure, ma&rsquo;am, I
know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say but what <i>edication</i> is a
great thing.&nbsp; But then, ma&rsquo;am, <i>edication</i>
can&rsquo;t change the <i>natur</i> that&rsquo;s in one, they
say; and one&rsquo;s that born naturally bad and low, they say,
all the edication in the world won&rsquo;t do no good; and, for
my part, ma&rsquo;am, I know you knows best; but I should be
afraid to let any of those Villaintropic folks get into my house;
for nobody can tell the natur of them aforehand.&nbsp; I declare
it frights me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pomfret, I thought you had better sense: how would this
poor boy earn his bread? he would be forced to starve or steal,
if everybody had such prejudices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pomfret, who really was a good woman, was softened at this
idea, and said, &ldquo;God forbid he should starve or steal, and
God forbid I should say anything <i>prejudiciary</i> of the boy;
for there may be no harm in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Churchill, changing her tone,
&ldquo;but, Pomfret, if we don&rsquo;t like the boy at the end of
the month, we have done with him; for I have only promised Mr.
Spencer to keep him a month upon trial: there is no harm
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, no, ma&rsquo;am, to be sure; and cook must put up
with her disappointment, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What disappointment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About her nephew, ma&rsquo;am; the boy she and I was
speaking to you for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day you called her up about the almond pudding,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; If you remember, you said you should have no
objections to try the boy; and upon that cook bought him new
shirts; but they are to the good, as I tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did not promise to take her nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, no ma&rsquo;am, not at all; she does not think to
<i>say that</i>, else I should be very angry; but the poor woman
never let fall a word, any more than frets that the boy should
miss such a good place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but since I did say that I should have no
objection to try him, I shall keep my word; let him come
to-morrow.&nbsp; Let them both have a fair trial, and at the end
of the month I can decide which I like best, and which we had
better keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dismissed with these orders, Mrs. Pomfret hastened to report
all that had passed to the cook, like a favourite minister, proud
to display the extent of her secret influence.&nbsp; In the
morning Felix, the cook&rsquo;s nephew, arrived; and, the moment
he came into the kitchen, every eye, even the scullion&rsquo;s,
was fixed upon him with approbation, and afterwards glanced upon
Franklin with contempt&mdash;contempt which Franklin could not
endure without some confusion, though quite unconscious of having
deserved it; nor, upon the most impartial and cool
self-examination, could he comprehend the justice of his
judges.&nbsp; He perceived indeed&mdash;for the comparisons were
minutely made in audible and scornful whispers&mdash;that Felix
was a much handsomer, or as the kitchen maid expressed it, a much
more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he
was; and he was made to understand, that he wanted a frill to his
shirt, a cravat, a pair of thin shoes, and, above all, shoe
strings, besides other nameless advantages, which justly made his
rival the admiration of the kitchen.&nbsp; However, upon calling
to mind all that his friend Mr. Spencer had ever said to him, he
could not recollect his having warned him that shoe strings were
indispensable requisites to the character of a good servant; so
that he could only comfort himself with resolving, if possible,
to make amends for these deficiencies, and to dissipate the
prejudices which he saw were formed against him, by the strictest
adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his
duty.&nbsp; He hoped to secure the approbation of his mistress by
scrupulous obedience to all her commands, and faithful care of
all that belonged to her.&nbsp; At the same time he flattered
himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow servants by
showing a constant desire to oblige them.&nbsp; He pursued this
plan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks, and found that
he succeeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress;
but unfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow
servants, and he sometimes offended when he least expected
it.&nbsp; He had made great progress in the affections of
Corkscrew, the butler, by working indeed very hard for him, and
doing every day at least half his business.&nbsp; But one
unfortunate night the butler was gone out; the bell rang: he went
upstairs; and his mistress asking where Corkscrew was, he
answered that he was gone out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where to!&rdquo; said
his mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered
Franklin.&nbsp; And, as he had told exactly the truth, and meant
to do no harm, he was surprised, at the butler&rsquo;s return,
when he repeated to him what had passed, at receiving a sudden
box on the ear, and the appellation of a mischievous,
impertinent, mean-spirited brat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mischievous, impertinent, mean!&rdquo; repeated
Franklin to himself; but, looking in the butler&rsquo;s face,
which was a deeper scarlet than usual, he judged that he was far
from sober, and did not doubt but that the next morning, when he
came to the use of his reason, he would be sensible of his
injustice, and apologize for his box of the ear.&nbsp; But no
apology coming all day, Franklin at last ventured to request an
explanation, or rather, to ask what he had best do on the next
occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Corkscrew, &ldquo;when mistress asked
for me, how came you to say I was gone out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, you know, I saw you go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when she asked you where I was gone, how came you
to say that you did not know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, indeed, I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a stupid blockhead! could you not say I was
gone to the washerwoman&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>were</i> you?&rdquo; said Franklin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I?&rdquo; cried Corkscrew, and looked as if he
would have struck him again; &ldquo;how dare you give me the lie,
Mr. Hypocrite?&nbsp; You would be ready enough, I&rsquo;ll be
bound, to make excuses for yourself.&nbsp; Why are not
mistress&rsquo; clogs cleaned?&nbsp; Go along and blacken
&rsquo;em, this minute, and send Felix to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time forward Felix alone was privileged to enter the
butler&rsquo;s pantry.&nbsp; Felix became the favourite of
Corkscrew; and, though Franklin by no means sought to pry into
the mysteries of their private conferences, nor ever entered
without knocking at the door, yet it was his fate once to be sent
of a message at an unlucky time; and, as the door was half open,
he could not avoid seeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor,
which he could not help suspecting to be wine; and, as the
decanter, which usually went upstairs after dinner, was at this
time in the butler&rsquo;s grasp, without any stopper in it, he
was involuntarily forced to suspect they were drinking his
mistress&rsquo; wine.</p>
<p>Nor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which
Felix received: his aunt, the cook, had occasion for his
assistance, and she had many delicious douceurs in her
gift.&nbsp; Many a handful of currants, many a half-custard, many
a triangular remnant of pie, besides the choice of his own meal
at breakfast, dinner and supper, fell to the share of the
favourite Felix; whilst Franklin was neglected, though he took
the utmost pains to please the cook in all honourable service,
and, when she was hot, angry, or hurried, he was always at hand
to help her; and in the hour of adversity, when the clock struck
five, and no dinner was dished, and no kitchen maid with twenty
pair of hands was to be had, Franklin would answer to her call,
with flowers to garnish her dishes, and presence of mind to know,
in the midst of the commotion, where everything that was wanting
was to be found; so that, quick as lightning, all difficulties
vanished before him.&nbsp; Yet when the danger was over, and the
hour of adversity had past, the ungrateful cook would forget her
benefactor, and, when it came to his supper time, would throw
him, with a carelessness that touched him sensibly, anything
which the other servants were too nice to eat.&nbsp; All this
Franklin bore with fortitude; nor did he envy Felix the dainties
which he ate, sometimes close beside him: &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said
he to himself, &ldquo;I have a clear conscience, and that is more
than Felix can have.&nbsp; I know how he wins cook&rsquo;s favour
too well, and I fancy I know how I have offended her; for since
the day I saw the basket, she has done nothing but huff
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The history of the basket was this.&nbsp; Mrs. Pomfret, the
housekeeper, had several times, directly and indirectly, given
the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought
there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late.&nbsp; Now,
when she spoke, it was usually at dinner time; she always looked,
or Franklin imagined that she looked, suspiciously at him.&nbsp;
Other people looked more maliciously; but, as he felt himself
perfectly innocent, he went on eating his dinner in silence.</p>
<p>But at length it was time to explain.&nbsp; One Sunday there
appeared a handsome sirloin of beef, which before noon on Monday
had shrunk almost to the bare bone, and presented such a
deplorable spectacle to the opening eyes of Mrs. Pomfret that her
long smothered indignation burst forth, and she boldly declared
she was now certain there had been foul play, and she would have
the beef found, or she would know why.&nbsp; She spoke, but no
beef appeared, till Franklin, with a look of sudden recollection,
cried, &ldquo;Did not I see something like a piece of beef in a
basket in the dairy?&mdash;I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook, as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow, grew
pale; but, suddenly recovering the use of her speech, turned upon
Franklin, and, with a voice of thunder, gave him the lie direct;
and forthwith, taking Mrs. Pomfret by the ruffle, led the way to
the dairy, declaring she could defy the world&mdash;&ldquo;that
so she could, and would.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said she kicking an empty basket which lay on
the floor&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s malice for you.&nbsp; Ask
him why he don&rsquo;t show you the beef in the
basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw&mdash;&rdquo; poor Franklin began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought you saw!&rdquo; cried the cook, coming
close up to him with kimboed arms, and looking like a dragon;
&ldquo;and pray, sir, what business has such a one as you to
think you see?&nbsp; And pray, ma&rsquo;am, will you be pleased
to speak&mdash;perhaps, ma&rsquo;am, he&rsquo;ll condescend to
obey you&mdash;ma&rsquo;am, will you be pleased to forbid him my
dairy? for here he comes prying and spying about; and how,
ma&rsquo;am, am I to answer for my butter and cream, or anything
at all?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t
pretend to, unless you do me the justice to forbid him my
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pomfret, whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices
against the folks of the &ldquo;Villaintropic Society,&rdquo; and
also by her secret jealousy of a boy whom she deemed to be a
growing favourite of her mistress&rsquo;, took part with the
cook, and ended, as she began, with a firm persuasion that
Franklin was the guilty person.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him alone, let
him alone!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;he has as many turns and
windings as a hare; but we shall catch him yet, I&rsquo;ll be
bound, in some of his doublings.&nbsp; I knew the nature of him
well enough, from the first time I ever set my eyes upon him; but
mistress shall have her own way, and see the end of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, and the bitter sense of injustice, drew tears at
length fast down the proud cheek of Franklin, which might
possibly have touched Mrs. Pomfret, if Felix, with a sneer, had
not called them <i>crocodile tears</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Felix,
too!&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;this is too much.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
fact, Felix had till now professed himself his firm ally, and had
on his part received from Franklin unequivocal proofs of
friendship; for it must be told that every other morning, when it
was Felix&rsquo;s turn to get breakfast, Felix never was up in
decent time, and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if
Franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him, the
bread and butter spread, and the toast toasted; and had not,
moreover, regularly, when the clock struck eight, and Mrs.
Pomfret&rsquo;s foot was heard overhead, run to call the sleeping
Felix, and helped him constantly through the hurry of getting
dressed one instant before the housekeeper came downstairs.&nbsp;
All this could not but be present to his memory; but, seeming to
reproach him, Franklin wiped away his crocodile tears, and
preserved a magnanimous silence.</p>
<p>The hour of retribution was, however, not so far off as Felix
imagined.&nbsp; Cunning people may go on cleverly in their
devices for some time; but although they may escape once, twice,
perhaps ninety-nine times, what does that signify?&mdash;for the
hundredth time they come to shame, and lose all their
character.&nbsp; Grown bold by frequent success, Felix became
more careless in his operations; and it happened that one day he
met his mistress full in the passage, as he was going on one of
the cook&rsquo;s secret errands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Felix?&rdquo; said his
mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the washerwoman&rsquo;s, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
answered he, with his usual effrontery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call at the
bookseller&rsquo;s in&mdash;stay, I must write down the
direction.&nbsp; Pomfret,&rdquo; said she, opening the
housekeeper&rsquo;s room door, &ldquo;have you a bit of
paper?&rdquo;&nbsp; Pomfret came with the writing-paper, and
looked very angry to see that Felix was going out without her
knowledge; so, while Mrs. Churchill was writing the direction,
she stood talking to him about it; whilst he, in the greatest
terror imaginable, looked up in her face as she spoke; but was
all the time intent on parrying on the other side the attacks of
a little French dog of his mistress&rsquo;, which, unluckily for
him, had followed her into the passage.&nbsp; Manchon was
extremely fond of Felix, who, by way of pleasing his mistress,
had paid most assiduous court to her dog; yet now his caresses
were rather troublesome.&nbsp; Manchon leaped up, and was not to
be rebuffed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor fellow&mdash;poor
fellow&mdash;down! down! poor fellow!&rdquo; cried Felix, and put
him away.&nbsp; But Manchon leaped up again, and began smelling
near the fatal pocket in a most alarming manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
will see by this direction where you are to go,&rdquo; said his
mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Manchon, come here&mdash;and you will be
so good as to bring me&mdash;down! down! Manchon, be
quiet!&rdquo;&nbsp; But Manchon knew better&mdash;he had now got
his head into Felix&rsquo;s pocket, and would not be quiet till
he had drawn from thence, rustling out of its brown paper, half a
cold turkey, which had been missing since morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cold turkey, as I&rsquo;m alive!&rdquo; exclaimed
the housekeeper, darting upon it with horror and amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; said Mrs. Churchill, in a
composed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered Felix,
so confused that he knew not what to say;
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Pomfret, indignation
flashing from her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; repeated
his mistress, waiting for his reply with a calm air of attention,
which still more disconcerted Felix; for, though with an angry
person he might have some chance of escape, he knew that he could
not invent any excuse in such circumstances, which could stand
the examination of a person in her sober senses.&nbsp; He was
struck dumb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said Mrs. Churchill, in a
still lower tone; &ldquo;I am ready to hear all you have to
say.&nbsp; In my house everybody shall have justice;
speak&mdash;but what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But</i>,&rdquo; stammered Felix; and, after in vain
attempting to equivocate, confessed that he was going to take the
turkey to his cousin&rsquo;s; but he threw all the blame upon his
aunt, the cook, who, he said, had ordered him upon this
expedition.</p>
<p>The cook was now summoned; but she totally denied all
knowledge of the affair, with the same violence with which she
had lately confounded Franklin about the beef in the basket; not
entirely, however, with the same success; for Felix, perceiving
by his mistress&rsquo; eye that she was on the point of desiring
him to leave the house immediately; and not being very willing to
leave a place in which he had lived so well with the butler, did
not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her
own.&nbsp; He knew how to bring his charge home to her.&nbsp; He
produced a note in her own handwriting, the purport of which was
to request her cousin&rsquo;s acceptance of &ldquo;some
<i>delicate cold turkey</i>,&rdquo; and to beg she would send
her, by the return of the bearer, a little of her
cherry-brandy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her
cook&rsquo;s discharge, and informed Felix she had no further
occasion for his services, but, upon his pleading with many
tears, which Franklin did not call <i>crocodile tears</i>, that
he was so young, that he was under the dominion of his aunt, he
touched Mrs. Pomfret&rsquo;s compassion, and she obtained for him
permission to stay till the end of the month, to give him yet a
chance of redeeming his character.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon,
resolved, for the future, to be more upon her guard with Felix,
and felt that she had treated Franklin with great injustice, when
she accused him of malpractices about the sirloin of beef.</p>
<p>Good people, when they are made sensible that they have
treated anyone with injustice, are impatient to have an
opportunity to rectify their mistake; and Mrs. Pomfret was now
prepared to see everything which Franklin did in the most
favourable point of view; especially as the next day she
discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for
her tea, and buttered her toast&mdash;services for which she had
always thought she was indebted to Felix.&nbsp; Besides, she had
rated Felix&rsquo;s abilities very highly, because he made up her
weekly accounts for her; but unluckily once, when Franklin was
out of the way, and she brought a bill in a hurry to her
favourite to cast up, she discovered that he did not know how to
cast up pounds, shillings and pence, and he was obliged to
confess that she must wait till Franklin came home.</p>
<p>But, passing over a number of small incidents which gradually
unfolded the character of the two boys, we must proceed to a more
serious affair.</p>
<p>Corkscrew frequently, after he had finished taking away
supper, and after the housekeeper was gone to bed, sallied forth
to a neighbouring alehouse to drink with his friends.&nbsp; The
alehouse was kept by that cousin of Felix&rsquo;s, who was so
fond of &ldquo;<i>delicate</i> cold turkey,&rdquo; and who had
such choice cherry-brandy.&nbsp; Corkscrew kept the key of the
house door, so that he could return home whenever he thought
proper; and, if he should by accident be called for by his
mistress after supper, Felix knew where to find him, and did not
scruple to make any of those excuses which poor Franklin had too
much integrity to use.</p>
<p>All these precautions taken, the butler was at liberty to
indulge his favourite passion, which so increased with
indulgence, that his wages were by no means sufficient to support
him in this way of life.&nbsp; Every day he felt less resolution
to break through his bad habits; for every day drinking became
more necessary to him.&nbsp; His health was ruined.&nbsp; With a
red, pimpled, bloated face, emaciated legs, and a swelled,
diseased body, he appeared the victim of intoxication.&nbsp; In
the morning, when he got up, his hands trembled, his spirits
flagged, he could do nothing until he had taken a dram&mdash;an
operation which he was obliged to repeat several times in the
course of the day, as all those wretched people <i>must</i> who
once acquire this habit.</p>
<p>He had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented;
and the landlord, who grew urgent for his money, refused to give
further credit.</p>
<p>One night, when Corkscrew had drunk enough only to make him
fretful, he leaned with his elbow surlily upon the table, began
to quarrel with the landlord, and swore that he had not of late
treated him like a gentleman.&nbsp; To which the landlord coolly
replied, &ldquo;That as long as he had paid like a gentleman, he
had been treated like one, and that was as much as anyone could
expect, or, at any rate, as much as anyone would meet with in
this world.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the truth of this assertion he
appealed, laughing, to a party of men who were drinking in the
room.&nbsp; The men, however, took part with Corkscrew, and,
drawing him over to their table, made him sit down with
them.&nbsp; They were in high good-humour, and the butler soon
grew so intimate with them, that, in the openness of his heart,
he soon communicated to them, not only all his own affairs, but
all that he knew, and more than all that he knew, of his
mistress&rsquo;.</p>
<p>His new friends were by no means uninterested by his
conversation, and encouraged him as much as possible to talk; for
they had secret views, which the butler was by no means
sufficiently sober to discover.</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill had some fine old family plate; and these men
belonged to a gang of housebreakers.&nbsp; Before they parted
with Corkscrew, they engaged him to meet them again the next
night; their intimacy was still more closely cemented.&nbsp; One
of the men actually offered to lend Corkscrew three guineas
towards the payment of his debt, and hinted that, if he thought
proper, he could easily get the whole cleared off.&nbsp; Upon
this hint, Corkscrew became all attention, till, after some
hesitation on their part, and repeated promises of secrecy on
his, they at length disclosed their plans to him.&nbsp; They gave
him to understand, that if he would assist in letting them into
his mistress&rsquo; house, they would let him have an ample share
in the booty.&nbsp; The butler, who had the reputation of being
an honest man, and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof
against everything but his mistress&rsquo; port, turned pale, and
trembled at this proposal; drank two or three bumpers to drown
thought; and promised to give an answer the next day.</p>
<p>He went home more than half-intoxicated.&nbsp; His mind was so
full of what had passed, that he could not help bragging to
Felix, whom he found awake at his return, that he could have his
bill paid off at the alehouse whenever he pleased; dropping,
besides, some hints, which were not lost upon Felix.</p>
<p>In the morning Felix reminded him of the things which he had
said; and Corkscrew, alarmed, endeavoured to evade his questions,
by saying that he was not in his senses when he talked in that
manner.&nbsp; Nothing, however, that he could urge made any
impression upon Felix, whose recollection on the subject was
perfectly distinct, and who had too much cunning himself, and too
little confidence in his companion, to be the dupe of his
dissimulation.&nbsp; The butler knew not what to do when he saw
that Felix was absolutely determined either to betray their
scheme, or to become a sharer in the booty.</p>
<p>The next night came, and he was now to make a final decision;
either to determine on breaking off entirely with his new
acquaintances, or taking Felix with him to join in the plot.</p>
<p>His debt, his love of drinking, the impossibility of indulging
it without a fresh supply of money, all came into his mind at
once, and conquered his remaining scruples.&nbsp; It is said by
those whose fatal experience gives them a right to be believed,
that a drunkard will sacrifice anything, everything, sooner than
the pleasure of habitual intoxication.</p>
<p>How much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to
break through it when once formed!</p>
<p>The hour of rendezvous came, and Corkscrew went to the
alehouse, where he found the housebreakers waiting for him, and a
glass of brandy ready poured out.&nbsp; He
sighed&mdash;drank&mdash;hesitated&mdash;drank again&mdash;heard
the landlord talk of his bill, saw the money produced which would
pay it in a moment&mdash;drank again&mdash;cursed himself, and,
giving his hand to the villain who was whispering in his ear,
swore that he could not help it, and must do as they would have
him.&nbsp; They required of him to give up the key of the house
door, that they might get another made by it.&nbsp; He had left
it with Felix, and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty
which had arisen.&nbsp; Felix knew enough to ruin them, and must
therefore be won over.&nbsp; This was no very difficult task; he
had a strong desire to have some worked cravats, and the butler
knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient
bribe.&nbsp; The cravats were bought and shown to Felix.&nbsp; He
thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete, fine
gentleman; and to go without them, especially when he had once
seen himself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow,
appeared impossible.&nbsp; Even this paltry temptation, working
upon his vanity, at length prevailed with a boy whose integrity
had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and
daily falsehood.&nbsp; It was agreed that, the first time his
mistress sent him out on a message, he should carry the key of
the house door to his cousin&rsquo;s, and deliver it into the
hands of one of the gang, who were there in waiting for it.&nbsp;
Such was the scheme.</p>
<p>Felix, the night after all this had been planned, went to bed,
and fell fast asleep; but the butler, who had not yet stifled the
voice of conscience, felt, in the silence of the night, so
insupportably miserable, that, instead of going to rest, he stole
softly into the pantry for a bottle of his mistress&rsquo; wine,
and there drinking glass after glass, he stayed till he became so
far intoxicated, that, though he contrived to find his way back
to bed, he could by no means undress himself.&nbsp; Without any
power of recollection, he flung himself upon the bed, leaving his
candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him.&nbsp;
Franklin slept in the next room to him, and presently awaking,
thought he perceived a strong smell of something burning.&nbsp;
He jumped up, and seeing a light under the butler&rsquo;s door,
gently opened it, and to his astonishment, beheld one of the bed
curtains in flames.&nbsp; He immediately ran to the butler, and
pulled him with all his force, to rouse him from his
lethargy.&nbsp; He came to his senses at length, but was so
terrified, and so helpless, that, if it had not been for
Franklin, the whole house would soon inevitably have been on
fire.&nbsp; Felix, trembling and cowardly, knew not what to do;
and it was curious to see him obeying Franklin, whose turn it now
was to command.&nbsp; Franklin ran upstairs to awaken Mrs.
Pomfret, whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her
room almost out of her senses, whilst he, with the greatest
presence of mind, recollected where he had seen two large tubs of
water, which the maids had prepared the night before for their
washing, and seizing the wet linen which had been left to soak,
he threw them upon the flames.&nbsp; He exerted himself with so
much good sense, that the fire was presently extinguished.</p>
<p>Everything was now once more safe and quiet.&nbsp; Mrs.
Pomfret, recovering from her fright, postponed all inquiries till
the morning, and rejoiced that her mistress had not been
awakened, whilst Corkscrew flattered himself that he should be
able to conceal the true cause of the accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell Mrs. Pomfret where you found the
candle when you came into the room,&rdquo; said he to
Franklin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she asks me, you know I must tell the truth,&rdquo;
replied he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must!&rdquo; repeated Felix, sneeringly; &ldquo;what,
you <i>must</i> be a tell-tale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never told any tales of anybody, and I should be
very sorry to get anyone into a scrape; but for all that I shall
not tell a lie, either for myself or anybody else, let you call
me what names you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I were to give you something that you would
like,&rdquo; said Corkscrew&mdash;&ldquo;something that I know
you would like!&rdquo; repeated Felix.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing you can give me will do,&rdquo; answered
Franklin, steadily, &ldquo;so it is useless to say any more about
it&mdash;I hope I shall not be questioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this hope he was mistaken; for the first thing Mrs. Pomfret
did in the morning was to come into the room to examine and
deplore the burnt curtains, whilst Corkscrew stood by,
endeavouring to exculpate himself by all the excuses he could
invent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pomfret, however, though sometimes blinded by her
prejudices, was no fool; and it was absolutely impossible to make
her believe that a candle, which had been left on the hearth,
where Corkscrew protested he had left it, could have set curtains
on fire which were at least six feet distant.&nbsp; Turning short
round to Franklin, she desired that he would show her where he
found the candle when he came into the room.&nbsp; He took up the
candlestick; but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it,
she snatched it from his hands; &ldquo;How did this candlestick
come here?&nbsp; This was not the candlestick you found here last
night,&rdquo; cried she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, indeed it was,&rdquo;
answered Franklin.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo;
retorted she, vehemently, &ldquo;for I left this candlestick with
my own hands last night, in the hall, the last thing I did, after
you,&rdquo; said she, turning to the butler, &ldquo;was gone to
bed&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of it&mdash;Nay, don&rsquo;t you
recollect my taking this <i>japanned candlestick</i> out of your
hand, and making you to go up to bed with the brass one, and I
bolted the door at the stair-head after you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all very true; but Corkscrew had afterwards gone down
from his room by a back staircase, unbolted that door, and, upon
his return from the alehouse, had taken the japanned candlestick
by mistake upstairs, and had left the brass one in its stead upon
the hall table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Felix, &ldquo;indeed you
forget; for Mr. Corkscrew came into my room to desire me to call
him betimes in the morning, and I happened to take particular
notice, and he had the japanned candlestick in his hand, and that
was just as I heard you, bolting the door. Indeed, ma&rsquo;am
you forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Pomfret, rising in
anger, &ldquo;I do not forget; I&rsquo;m not come to be
<i>supperannuated</i> yet, I hope.&nbsp; How do you dare to tell
me I forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried Felix, &ldquo;I beg your
pardon, I did not&mdash;I did not mean to say you forgot, but
only I thought, perhaps, you might not particularly remember; for
if you please to recollect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t please to recollect just whatever you
please, sir!&nbsp; Hold your tongue; why should you poke yourself
into this scrape; what have you to do with it, I should be glad
to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in the world, oh nothing in the world;
I&rsquo;m sure I beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered
Felix, in a soft tone; and, sneaking off, left his friend
Corkscrew to fight his own battle, secretly resolving to desert
in good time, if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions
coming to light.</p>
<p>Corkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself
and, conscious of guilt, he turned pale, and appeared so much
more terrified than butlers usually appear when detected in a
lie, that Mrs. Pomfret resolved, as she said, to sift the matter
to the bottom.&nbsp; Impatiently did she wait till the clock
struck nine, and her mistress&rsquo; bell rang, the signal for
her attendance at her levee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you find yourself this morning,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; said she, undrawing the curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sleepy, indeed,&rdquo; answered her mistress in a
drowsy voice; &ldquo;I think I must sleep half an hour
longer&mdash;shut the curtains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, ma&rsquo;am; but I suppose I had better
open a little of the window shutter, for it&rsquo;s past
nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just struck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, ma&rsquo;am, it struck before I came upstairs,
and you know we are twenty minutes slow&mdash;Lord bless
us!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, as she let fall the bar of the
window, which roused her mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
beg your pardon a thousand times&mdash;it&rsquo;s only the
bar&mdash;because I had this great key in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put down the key, then, or you&rsquo;ll knock something
else down; and you may open the shutters now; for I&rsquo;m quite
awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! I&rsquo;m so sorry to think of disturbing
you,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Pomfret, at the same time throwing the
shutters wide open; &ldquo;but, to be sure, ma&rsquo;am, I have
something to tell you, which won&rsquo;t let you sleep again in a
hurry.&nbsp; I brought up this here key of the house door for
reasons of my own, which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll approve of;
but I&rsquo;m not come to that part of my story yet.&nbsp; I hope
you were not disturbed by the noise in the house last night,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard no noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised at that, though,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Pomfret, and proceeded to give a most ample account of the fire,
of her fears, and her suspicions.&nbsp; &ldquo;To be sure,
ma&rsquo;am, what I say <i>is</i>, that, without the spirit of
prophecy, one can nowadays account for what has passed.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m quite clear in my own judgment, that Mr. Corkscrew must
have been out last night after I went to bed; for, besides the
japanned candlestick, which of itself I&rsquo;m sure is strong
enough to hang a man, there&rsquo;s another circumstance,
ma&rsquo;am, that certifies it to me&mdash;though I have not
mentioned it, ma&rsquo;am, to no one yet,&rdquo; lowering her
voice&mdash;&ldquo;Franklin, when I questioned him, told me, that
he left the lantern in the outside porch in the court last night,
and this morning it was on the kitchen table.&nbsp; Now,
ma&rsquo;am, that lantern could not come without hands; and I
could not forget about that, you know; for Franklin says,
he&rsquo;s sure he left the lantern out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you believe <i>him</i>?&rdquo; inquired her
mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;how can I help believing
him?&nbsp; I never found him out in the least symptom of a lie
since ever he came into the house; so one can&rsquo;t help
believing in him, like him or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without meaning to tell a falsehood, however,&rdquo;
said the lady, &ldquo;he might make a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, he never makes mistakes; it is not his
way to go gossiping and tattling; he never tells anything till
he&rsquo;s asked, and then it&rsquo;s fit he should.&nbsp; About
the sirloin of beef, and all, he was right in the end, I found,
to do him justice; and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s right now about
the lantern&mdash;he&rsquo;s <i>alway&rsquo;s
right</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill could not help smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had seen him, ma&rsquo;am, last night in the
midst of the fire&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure we may thank him that we
were not burned alive in our beds&mdash;and I shall never forget
his coming to call me.&nbsp; Poor fellow! he that I was always
scolding and scolding, enough to make him hate me.&nbsp; But
he&rsquo;s too good to hate anybody; and I&rsquo;ll be bound
I&rsquo;ll make it up to him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care that you don&rsquo;t go from one extreme into
another, Pomfret; don&rsquo;t spoil the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, there&rsquo;s no danger of that; but
I&rsquo;m sure if you had seen him last night yourself, you would
think he deserved to be rewarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he shall be rewarded,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Churchill; &ldquo;but I will try him more fully yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion, I think, for trying him any
more, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pomfret, who was as violent
in her likings as in her dislikes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray desire,&rdquo; continued her mistress, &ldquo;that
he will bring up breakfast this morning; and leave the key of the
house-door, Pomfret, with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Franklin brought the urn into the breakfast-parlour, his
mistress was standing by the fire with the key in her hand.&nbsp;
She spoke to him of his last night&rsquo;s exertions in terms of
much approbation.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long have you lived with
me?&rdquo; said she, pausing; &ldquo;three weeks, I
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three weeks and four days, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is but a short time; yet you have conducted
yourself so as to make me think I may depend upon you.&nbsp; You
know this key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe, madam, it is the key of the
house-door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is; I shall trust it in your care.&nbsp; It is a
great trust for so young a person as you are.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Franklin stood silent, with a firm but modest look.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you take the charge of this key,&rdquo; continued his
mistress, &ldquo;remember it is upon condition that you never
give it out of your own hands.&nbsp; In the daytime it must not
be left in the door.&nbsp; You must not tell anybody where you
keep it at night; and the house-door must not be unlocked after
eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, unless by my orders.&nbsp; Will
you take charge of the key upon these conditions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, madam, do anything you order me,&rdquo; said
Franklin, and received the key from her hands.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Churchill&rsquo;s orders were made known, they
caused many secret marvellings and murmurings.&nbsp; Corkscrew
and Felix were disconcerted, and dared not openly avow their
discontent; and they treated Franklin with the greatest seeming
kindness and cordiality.</p>
<p>Everything went on smoothly for three days.&nbsp; The butler
never attempted his usual midnight visits to the alehouse, but
went to bed in proper time, and paid particular court to Mrs.
Pomfret, in order to dispel her suspicions.&nbsp; She had never
had any idea of the real fact, that he and Felix were joined in a
plot with house-breakers to rob the house, but thought he only
went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his passion for
drinking.</p>
<p>Thus stood affairs the night before Mrs. Churchill&rsquo;s
birthday.&nbsp; Corkscrew, by the housekeeper&rsquo;s means,
ventured to present a petition that he might go to the play the
next day, and his request was granted.&nbsp; Franklin came into
the kitchen just when all the servants had gathered round the
butler, who, with great importance, was reading aloud the
play-bill.&nbsp; Everybody present soon began to speak at once,
and with great enthusiasm talked of the playhouse, the actors,
and actresses; and then Felix, in the first pause, turned to
Franklin, and said, &ldquo;Lord, you know nothing of all this!
<i>you</i> never went to a play, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Franklin, and felt, he did not know
why, a little ashamed; and he longed extremely to go to one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should you like to go to the play with me
to-morrow?&rdquo; said Corkscrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Franklin, &ldquo;I should like it
exceedingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think mistress would let you if I
asked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think maybe she would, if Mrs. Pomfret asked
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then you have no money, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Franklin, sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stay,&rdquo; said Corkscrew, &ldquo;what I am
thinking of is, that if mistress will let you go, I&rsquo;ll
treat you myself, rather than that you should he
disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delight, surprise and gratitude appeared in Franklin&rsquo;s
face at these words.&nbsp; Corkscrew rejoiced to see that now, at
least, he had found a most powerful temptation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well
then, I&rsquo;ll go just now and ask her.&nbsp; In the meantime,
lend me the key of the house door for a minute or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key!&rdquo; answered Franklin, starting;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t do that, for I&rsquo;ve
promised my mistress never to let it out of my own
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will she know anything of the matter?&nbsp;
Run, run, and get it for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I <i>cannot</i>,&rdquo; replied Franklin, resisting
the push which the butler gave his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; cried Corkscrew, changing his
tone; &ldquo;then, sir, I can&rsquo;t take you to the
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said Franklin, sorrowfully, but
with steadiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said Felix, mimicking him,
&ldquo;you need not look so important, nor fancy yourself such a
great man, because you&rsquo;re master of a key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more to him,&rdquo; interrupted Corkscrew:
&ldquo;let him alone to take his own way.&nbsp; Felix, you would
have no objection, I suppose, to going to the play with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should like it of all things, if I did not come
between anybody else.&nbsp; But come, come!&rdquo; added the
hypocrite, assuming a tone of friendly persuasion, &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t be such a blockhead, Franklin, as to lose going to
the play for nothing; it&rsquo;s only just obstinacy.&nbsp; What
harm can it do, to lend Mr. Corkscrew the key for five minutes?
he&rsquo;ll give it to you back again safe and sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt <i>that</i>,&rdquo; answered
Franklin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must be all because you don&rsquo;t wish to
oblige Mr. Corkscrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I can&rsquo;t oblige him in this; for, as I
told you before, my mistress trusted me.&nbsp; I promised never
to let the key out of my own hands, and you would not have me
break my trust.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer told me <i>that</i> was worse
than <i>robbing</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word <i>robbing</i> both Corkscrew and Felix
involuntarily cast down their eyes, and turned the conversation
immediately, saying, that he did very right; that they did not
really want the key, and had only asked for it just to try if he
would keep his word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shake hands,&rdquo; said
Corkscrew, &ldquo;I am glad to find you out to be an honest
fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you did not think me an honest fellow
before, Mr. Corkscrew,&rdquo; said Franklin, giving his hand
rather proudly, and he walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall make no hand of this prig,&rdquo; said
Corkscrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll have the key from him in spite of all
his obstinacy,&rdquo; said Felix; &ldquo;and let him make his
story good as he can afterwards.&nbsp; He shall repent of these
airs.&nbsp; To-night I&rsquo;ll watch him, and find out where he
hides the key; and when he&rsquo;s asleep we&rsquo;ll get it
without thanking him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan Felix put into execution.&nbsp; They discovered the
place where Franklin kept the key at night, stole it whilst he
slept, took off the impression in wax, and carefully replaced it
in Franklin&rsquo;s trunk, exactly where they found it.</p>
<p>Probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could
mean to make of this impression of the key in wax.&nbsp; Knowing
how to do mischief is very different from wishing to do it: and
the most innocent persons are generally the least ignorant.&nbsp;
By means of the impression, which they had thus obtained,
Corkscrew and Felix proposed to get a false key made by Picklock,
a smith who belonged to their gang of house-breakers; and with
this false key knew they could open the door whenever they
pleased.</p>
<p>Little suspecting what had happened, Franklin, the next
morning went to unlock the house door, as usual; but finding the
key entangled in the lock, he took it out to examine it, and
perceived a lump of wax sticking in one of the wards.&nbsp;
Struck with this circumstance, it brought to his mind all that
had passed the preceding evening, and being sure that he had no
wax near the key, he began to suspect what had happened; and he
could not help recollecting what he had once heard Felix say,
that &ldquo;give him but a halfpenny worth of wax, and he could
open the strongest lock that ever was made by hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these things considered, Franklin resolved to take the key
just as it was, with the wax sticking to it, to his mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not mistaken when I thought I might trust
<i>you</i> with this key,&rdquo; said Mrs. Churchill, after she
had heard his story.&nbsp; &ldquo;My brother will be here to-day,
and I shall consult him.&nbsp; In the meantime, say nothing of
what has passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evening came, and after tea Mr. Spencer sent for Franklin
upstairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;So, Mr. Franklin,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to find you are in such high <i>trust</i>
in this family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Franklin bowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you
have lost, I understand, the pleasure of going to the play
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything&mdash;much, I mean, of
that, sir,&rdquo; answered Franklin, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are Corkscrew and Felix <i>gone</i> to the
play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; half an hour ago, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall look into his room, and examine the pantry
and the plate that is under his care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Mr. Spencer came to examine the pantry, he found the
large salvers and cups in a basket behind the door, and the other
things placed so as to be easily carried off.&nbsp; Nothing at
first appeared in Corkscrew&rsquo;s bedchamber, to strengthen
their suspicions, till, just as they were going to leave the
room, Mrs. Pomfret exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, if there is not Mr.
Corkscrew&rsquo;s dress coat hanging up there! and if here
isn&rsquo;t Felix&rsquo;s fine cravat that he wanted in such a
hurry to go to the play!&nbsp; Why, sir, they can&rsquo;t be gone
to the play.&nbsp; Look at the cravat.&nbsp; Ah! upon my word I
am afraid they are not at the play.&nbsp; No, sir, you may be
sure that they are plotting with their barbarous gang at the
alehouse; and they&rsquo;ll certainly break into the house
to-night.&nbsp; We shall all be murdered in our beds, as sure as
I&rsquo;m a living woman, sir; but if you&rsquo;ll only take my
advice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, good Mrs. Pomfret,&rdquo; Mr. Spencer observed,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t be alarmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir, but I won&rsquo;t pretend to sleep in the
house, if Franklin isn&rsquo;t to have a blunderbuss, and I a
<i>baggonet</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have both, indeed, Mrs. Pomfret; but
don&rsquo;t make such a noise, for everybody will hear
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The love of mystery was the only thing which could have
conquered Mrs. Pomfret&rsquo;s love of talking.&nbsp; She was
silent, and contented herself the rest of the evening with making
signs, looking <i>ominous</i>, and stalking about the house like
one possessed with a secret.</p>
<p>Escaped from Mrs. Pomfret&rsquo;s fears and advice, Mr.
Spencer went to a shop within a few doors of the alehouse, which
he heard Corkscrew frequented, and sent to beg to speak to the
landlord.&nbsp; He came; and, when Mr. Spencer questioned him,
confessed that Corkscrew and Felix were actually drinking in his
house with two men of suspicious appearance; that, as he passed
through the passage, he heard them disputing about a key; and
that one of them said, &ldquo;Since we&rsquo;ve got the key,
we&rsquo;ll go about it to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
sufficient information.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer, lest the landlord
should give them information of what was going forwards, took him
along with him to Bow Street.</p>
<p>A constable and proper assistance was sent to Mrs.
Churchill&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They stationed themselves in a back
parlour which opened on a passage leading to the butler&rsquo;s
pantry, where the plate was kept.&nbsp; A little after midnight
they heard the hall door open.&nbsp; Corkscrew and his
accomplices went directly to the pantry; and there Mr. Spencer
and the constable immediately secured them, as they were carrying
off their booty.</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill and Pomfret had spent the night at the house of
an acquaintance in the same street.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pomfret, who had heard all the news
in the morning, &ldquo;the villains are all safe, thank
God.&nbsp; I was afraid to go to the window this morning; but it
was my luck to see them all go by to gaol.&nbsp; They looked so
shocking!&nbsp; I am sure I never shall forget Felix&rsquo;s look
to my dying day!&nbsp; But poor Franklin! ma&rsquo;am; that boy
has the best heart in the world.&nbsp; I could not get him to
give a second look at them as they passed.&nbsp; Poor fellow! I
thought he would have dropped; and he was so modest, ma&rsquo;am,
when Mr. Spencer spoke to him, and told him he had done his
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did my brother tell him what reward I intend for
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, and I&rsquo;m sure Franklin thinks no
more of <i>reward</i> than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Churchill, &ldquo;to
sell some of my old useless plate, and to lay it out in an
annuity for Franklin&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;La, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, with
unfeigned joy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you are very good; and
I&rsquo;m very glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Churchill, &ldquo;here are
some tickets for the play, which I shall beg you, Pomfret, to
give him, and to take him with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, indeed, ma&rsquo;am; and
I&rsquo;ll go with him with all my heart, and choose such plays
as won&rsquo;t do no prejudice to his morality.&nbsp; And,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Pomfret, &ldquo;the night
after the fire I left him my great Bible and my watch, in my
will; for I never was more mistaken at the first in any boy in my
born days; but he has won me by his own <i>deserts</i>, and I
shall from this time forth love all the <i>Villaintropic</i>
folks for his sake.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Waked as her custom was, before the day,<br />
To do the observance due to sprightly May.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Dryden</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a retired hamlet on the borders
of Wales, between Oswestry and Shrewsbury, it is still the custom
to celebrate the 1st of May.</p>
<p>The children of the village, who look forward to this rural
festival with joyful eagerness, usually meet on the last day of
April to make up their nosegays for the morning and to choose
their queen.&nbsp; Their customary place of meeting is at a
hawthorn, which stands in a little green nook, open on one side
to a shady lane, and separated on the other side by a thick
sweet-brier and hawthorn hedge from the garden of an
attorney.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>This attorney began the world with nothing, but he contrived
to scrape together a good deal of money, everybody knew
how.&nbsp; He built a new house at the entrance of the village,
and had a large, well fenced garden, yet, notwithstanding his
fences, he never felt himself secure.&nbsp; Such were his
litigious habits, and his suspicious temper, that he was
constantly at variance with his simple and peaceable
neighbours.&nbsp; Some pig, or dog, or goat, or goose was for
ever trespassing.&nbsp; His complaints and his extortions wearied
and alarmed the whole hamlet.&nbsp; The paths in his fields were
at length unfrequented, his stiles were blocked up with stones or
stuffed with brambles and briers, so that not a gosling could
creep under, or a giant get over them.&nbsp; Indeed, so careful
were even the village children of giving offence to this
irritable man of the law, that they would not venture to fly a
kite near his fields lest it should entangle in his trees, or
fall upon his meadow.</p>
<p>Mr. Case, for this was the name of our attorney, had a son and
a daughter, to whose education he had not time to attend, as his
whole soul was intent upon accumulating for them a fortune.&nbsp;
For several years he suffered his children to run wild in the
village; but suddenly, on his being appointed to a considerable
agency, he began to think of making his children a little
genteel.&nbsp; He sent his son to learn Latin; he hired a maid to
wait upon his daughter Barbara; and he strictly forbade her
thenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children, who
had hitherto been her playfellows.&nbsp; They were not sorry for
this prohibition, because she had been their tyrant rather than
their companion.&nbsp; She was vexed to observe that her absence
was not regretted, and she was mortified to perceive that she
could not humble them by any display of airs and finery.</p>
<p>There was one poor girl, amongst her former associates, to
whom she had a peculiar dislike,&mdash;Susan Price, a sweet
tempered, modest, sprightly, industrious lass, who was the pride
and delight of the village.&nbsp; Her father rented a small farm,
and, unfortunately for him, he lived near Attorney Case.</p>
<p>Barbara used often to sit at her window, watching Susan at
work.&nbsp; Sometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the
beds, or weeding the borders; sometimes she was kneeling at her
beehive with fresh flowers for her bees; sometimes she was in the
poultry yard, scattering corn from her sieve amongst the eager
chickens; and in the evening she was often seated in a little
honeysuckle arbour, with a clean, light, three-legged deal table
before her, upon which she put her plain work.</p>
<p>Susan had been taught to work neatly by her good mother, who
was very fond of her, and to whom she was most gratefully
attached.</p>
<p>Mrs. Price was an intelligent, active, domestic woman; but her
health was not robust.&nbsp; She earned money, however, by taking
in plain work; and she was famous for baking excellent bread and
breakfast cakes.&nbsp; She was respected in the village, for her
conduct as a wife and as a mother, and all were eager to show her
attention.&nbsp; At her door the first branch of hawthorn was
always placed on May morning, and her Susan was usually Queen of
the May.</p>
<p>It was now time to choose the Queen.&nbsp; The setting sun
shone full upon the pink blossoms of the hawthorn, when the merry
group assembled upon their little green.&nbsp; Barbara was now
walking in sullen state in her father&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp; She
heard the busy voices in the lane, and she concealed herself
behind the high hedge, that she might listen to their
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Susan?&rdquo; were the first unwelcome
words which she overheard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, where&rsquo;s
Susan?&rdquo; repeated Philip, stopping short in the middle of a
new tune that he was playing on his pipe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish
Susan would come!&nbsp; I want her to sing me this same tune over
again; I have not it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wish Susan would come, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
cried a little girl, whose lap was full of primroses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Susan will give me some thread to tie up my nosegays, and
she&rsquo;ll show me where the fresh violets grow; and she has
promised to give me a great bunch of her double cowslips to wear
to-morrow.&nbsp; I wish she would come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be done without Susan!&nbsp; She always
shows us where the nicest flowers are to be found in the lanes
and meadows,&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; &ldquo;She must make up the
garlands; and she shall be Queen of the May!&rdquo; exclaimed a
multitude of little voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she does not come!&rdquo; said Philip.</p>
<p>Rose, who was her particular friend, now came forward to
assure the impatient assembly, &ldquo;that she would answer for
it Susan would come as soon as she possibly could, and that she
probably was detained by business at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little electors thought that all business should give way
to theirs, and Rose was dispatched to summon her friend
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her to make haste,&rdquo; cried Philip.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Attorney Case dined at the Abbey to-day&mdash;luckily for
us.&nbsp; If he comes home and finds us here, maybe he&rsquo;ll
drive us away; for he says this bit of ground belongs to his
garden: though that is not true, I&rsquo;m sure; for Farmer Price
knows, and says, it was always open to the road.&nbsp; The
Attorney wants to get our playground, so he does.&nbsp; I wish he
and his daughter Bab, or Miss Barbara, as she must now be called,
were a hundred miles off, out of our way, I know.&nbsp; No later
than yesterday she threw down my nine-pins in one of her
ill-humours, as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in
the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Mary, the little primrose-girl,
&ldquo;her gown is always trailing.&nbsp; She does not hold it up
nicely, like Susan; and with all her fine clothes she never looks
half so neat.&nbsp; Mamma says she wishes I may be like Susan,
when I grow up to be a great girl, and so do I.&nbsp; I should
not like to look conceited as Barbara does, if I was ever so
rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich or poor,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;it does not
become a girl to look conceited, much less <i>bold</i>, as
Barbara did the other day, when she was at her father&rsquo;s
door without a hat upon her head, staring at the strange
gentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink.&nbsp; I
know what he thought of Bab by his looks, and of Susan, too; for
Susan was in her garden, bending down a branch of the
laburnum-tree, looking at its yellow flowers, which were just
come out; and when the gentleman asked her how many miles it was
from Shrewsbury, she answered him so modest!&mdash;not bashful,
like as if she had never seen nobody before&mdash;but just right;
and then she pulled on her straw hat, which was fallen back with
her looking up at the laburnum, and she went her ways home; and
the gentleman says to me, after she was gone, &lsquo;Pray, who is
that neat, modest girl&mdash;?&rsquo;&nbsp; But I wish Susan
would come,&rdquo; cried Philip, interrupting himself.</p>
<p>Susan was all this time, as her friend Rose rightly guessed,
busy at home.&nbsp; She was detained by her father&rsquo;s
returning later than usual.&nbsp; His supper was ready for him
nearly an hour before he came home; and Susan swept up the ashes
twice, and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze for him;
but at last, when he did come in, he took no notice of the blaze
or of Susan; and when his wife asked him how he did, he made no
answer, but stood with his back to the fire, looking very
gloomy.&nbsp; Susan put his supper upon the table, and set his
own chair for him; but he pushed away the chair and turned from
the table, saying&mdash;&ldquo;I shall eat nothing, child!&nbsp;
Why have you such a fire to roast me at this time of the
year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said yesterday, father, I thought, that you liked a
little cheerful wood fire in the evening; and there was a great
shower of hail; your coat is quite wet, we must dry
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it, then, child,&rdquo; said he, pulling it
off&mdash;&ldquo;I shall soon have no coat to dry&mdash;and take
my hat, too,&rdquo; said he, throwing it upon the ground.</p>
<p>Susan hung up his hat, put his coat over the back of a chair
to dry, and then stood anxiously looking at her mother, who was
not well; she had this day fatigued herself with baking; and now,
alarmed by her husband&rsquo;s moody behaviour, she sat down pale
and trembling.&nbsp; He threw himself into a chair, folded his
arms, and fixed his eyes upon the fire.</p>
<p>Susan was the first who ventured to break silence.&nbsp; Happy
the father who has such a daughter as Susan!&mdash;her unaltered
sweetness of temper, and her playful, affectionate caresses, at
last somewhat dissipated her father&rsquo;s melancholy.</p>
<p>He could not be prevailed upon to eat any of the supper which
had been prepared for him; however, with a faint smile, he told
Susan that he thought he could eat one of her guinea-hen&rsquo;s
eggs.&nbsp; She thanked him, and with that nimble alacrity which
marks the desire to please, she ran to her neat chicken-yard;
but, alas! her guinea-hen was not there&mdash;it had strayed into
the attorney&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp; She saw it through the paling,
and timidly opening the little gate, she asked Miss Barbara, who
was walking slowly by, to let her come in and take her
guinea-hen.&nbsp; Barbara, who was at this instant reflecting,
with no agreeable feelings, upon the conversation of the village
children, to which she had recently listened, started when she
heard Susan&rsquo;s voice, and with a proud, ill-humoured look
and voice, refused her request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut the gate,&rdquo; said Barbara, &ldquo;you have no
business in our garden; and as for your hen, I shall keep it; it
is always flying in here, and plaguing us, and my father says it
is a trespasser; and he told me I might catch it and keep it the
next time it got in, and it is in now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Barbara
called to her maid, Betty, and bid her catch the mischievous
hen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my guinea-hen! my pretty guinea-hen!&rdquo; cried
Susan, as they hunted the frightened, screaming creature from
corner to corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we have got it!&rdquo; said Betty, holding it fast
by the legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now pay damages, Queen Susan, or good-bye to your
pretty guinea-hen,&rdquo; said Barbara, in an insulting tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damages! what damages?&rdquo; said Susan; &ldquo;tell
me what I must pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shilling,&rdquo; said Barbara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if sixpence would do!&rdquo; said Susan; &ldquo;I
have but sixpence of my own in the world, and here it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Barbara, turning her
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but hear me,&rdquo; cried Susan; &ldquo;let me at
least come in to look for its eggs.&nbsp; I only want <i>one</i>
for my father&rsquo;s supper; you shall have all the
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your father, or his supper to us? is he so
nice that he can eat none but guinea-hen&rsquo;s eggs?&rdquo;
said Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want your hen and your eggs,
pay for them, and you&rsquo;ll have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have but sixpence, and you say that won&rsquo;t
do,&rdquo; said Susan with a sigh, as she looked at her
favourite, which was in the maid&rsquo;s grasping hands,
struggling and screaming in vain.</p>
<p>Susan retired disconsolate.&nbsp; At the door of her
father&rsquo;s cottage she saw her friend Rose, who was just come
to summon her to the hawthorn bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all at the hawthorn, and I am come for
you.&nbsp; We can do nothing without <i>you</i>, dear
Susan,&rdquo; cried Rose, running to meet her, at the moment she
saw her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are chosen Queen of the May&mdash;come,
make haste.&nbsp; But what is the matter? why do you look so
sad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t wait for me;
I can&rsquo;t come to you, but,&rdquo; added she, pointing to the
tuft of double cowslips in the garden, &ldquo;gather those for
poor little Mary; I promised them to her, and tell her the
violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile, on the
right as we go to church.&nbsp; Good-bye! never mind me; I
can&rsquo;t come&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stay, for my father wants
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t turn away your face; I won&rsquo;t keep
you a moment; only tell me what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; said
her friend, following her into the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, not much,&rdquo; said Susan; &ldquo;only
that I wanted the egg in a great hurry for father, it would not
have vexed me&mdash;to be sure I should have clipped my
guinea-hen&rsquo;s wings, and then she could not have flown over
the hedge; but let us think no more about it, now,&rdquo; added
she, twinkling away a tear.</p>
<p>When Rose, however, learnt that her friend&rsquo;s guinea-hen
was detained prisoner by the attorney&rsquo;s daughter, she
exclaimed, with all the honest warmth of indignation, and
instantly ran back to tell the story to her companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barbara! ay; like father, like daughter,&rdquo; cried
Farmer Price, starting from the thoughtful attitude in which he
had been fixed, and drawing his chair closer to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see something is amiss with me,
wife&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he
lowered his voice, Susan, who was not sure that he wished she
should hear what he was going to say, retired from behind his
chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Susan, don&rsquo;t go; sit you down here, my
sweet Susan,&rdquo; said he, making room for her upon his chair;
&ldquo;I believe I was a little cross when I came in first
tonight; but I had something to vex me, as you shall hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a fortnight ago, you know, wife,&rdquo; continued
he, &ldquo;there was a balloting in our town for the militia; now
at that time I wanted but ten days of forty years of age; and the
attorney told me I was a fool for not calling myself plump
forty.&nbsp; But the truth is the truth, and it is what I think
fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it.&nbsp; So
I was drawn for a militiaman; but when I thought how loth you and
I would be to part, I was main glad to hear that I could get off
by paying eight or nine guineas for a substitute&mdash;only I had
not the nine guineas&mdash;for, you know, we had bad luck with
our sheep this year, and they died away one after
another&mdash;but that was no excuse, so I went to Attorney Case,
and, with a power of difficulty, I got him to lend me the money;
for which, to be sure, I gave him something, and left my lease of
our farm with him, as he insisted upon it, by way of security for
the loan.&nbsp; Attorney Case is too many for me.&nbsp; He has
found what he calls a flaw in my lease; and the lease, he tells
me, is not worth a farthing, and that he can turn us all out of
our farm to-morrow if he pleases; and sure enough he will please,
for I have thwarted him this day, and he swears he&rsquo;ll be
revenged of me.&nbsp; Indeed, he has begun with me badly enough
already.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not come to the worst part of my story
yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Farmer Price made a dead stop; and his wife and Susan
looked up in his face, breathless with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must come out,&rdquo; said he, with a short sigh;
&ldquo;I must leave you in three days, wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; said his wife, in a faint, resigned
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Susan, love, open the window.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Susan ran to open the window, and then returned to support her
mother&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; When she came a little to herself she
sat up, begged that her husband would go on, and that nothing
might be concealed from her.&nbsp; Her husband had no wish indeed
to conceal anything from a wife he loved so well; but, firm as he
was, and steady to his maxim, that the truth was the thing the
fittest to be spoken at all times, his voice faltered, and it was
with great difficulty that he brought himself to speak the whole
truth at this moment.</p>
<p>The fact was this.&nbsp; Case met Farmer Price as he was
coming home, whistling, from a new ploughed field.&nbsp; The
attorney had just dined at <i>The Abbey</i>.&nbsp; The Abbey was
the family seat of an opulent baronet in the neighbourhood, to
whom Mr. Case had been agent.&nbsp; The baronet died suddenly,
and his estate and title devolved to a younger brother, who was
now just arrived in the country, and to whom Mr. Case was eager
to pay his court, in hopes of obtaining his favour.&nbsp; Of the
agency he flattered himself that he was pretty secure; and he
thought that he might assume the tone of command towards the
tenants, especially towards one who was some guineas in debt, and
in whose lease there was a flaw.</p>
<p>Accosting the farmer in a haughty manner, the attorney began
with, &ldquo;So, Farmer Price, a word with you, if you
please.&nbsp; Walk on here, man, beside my horse, and
you&rsquo;ll hear me.&nbsp; You have changed your opinion, I
hope, about that bit of land&mdash;that corner at the end of my
garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As how, Mr. Case?&rdquo; said the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As how, man!&nbsp; Why, you said something about its
not belonging to me, when you heard me talk of inclosing it the
other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; said Price, &ldquo;and so I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Provoked and astonished at the firm tone in which these words
were pronounced, the attorney was upon the point of swearing that
he would have his revenge; but, as his passions were habitually
attentive to the <i>letter</i> of the law, he refrained from any
hasty expression, which might, he was aware, in a court of
justice, be hereafter brought against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend, Mr. Price,&rdquo; said he, in a soft
voice, and pale with suppressed rage.&nbsp; He forced a
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m under the necessity of calling in
the money I lent you some time ago, and you will please to take
notice, that it must be paid to-morrow morning.&nbsp; I wish you
a good evening.&nbsp; You have the money ready for me, I
daresay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;not a guinea of it;
but John Simpson, who was my substitute, has not left our village
yet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get the money back from him, and go myself,
if so be it must be so, into the militia&mdash;so I
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attorney did not expect such a determination, and he
represented, in a friendly, hypocritical tone to Price, that he
had no wish to drive him to such an extremity; that it would be
the height of folly in him <i>to run his head against a wall for
no purpose</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to take the
corner into your own garden, do you, Price?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;God forbid!
it&rsquo;s none of mine, I never take what does not belong to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, right, very proper, of course,&rdquo; said Mr.
Case; &ldquo;but then you have no interest in life in the land in
question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why so stiff about it, Price?&nbsp; All I want of
you to say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say that black is white, which I won&rsquo;t do, Mr.
Case.&nbsp; The ground is a thing not worth talking of; but
it&rsquo;s neither yours nor mine.&nbsp; In my memory, since the
<i>new</i> lane was made, it has always been open to the parish;
and no man shall inclose it with my good-will.&nbsp; Truth is
truth, and must be spoken; justice is justice, and should be
done, Mr. Attorney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And law is law, Mr. Farmer, and shall have its course,
to your cost,&rdquo; cried the attorney, exasperated by the
dauntless spirit of this village Hampden.</p>
<p>Here they parted.&nbsp; The glow of enthusiasm, the pride of
virtue, which made our hero brave, could not render him
insensible.&nbsp; As he drew nearer home, many melancholy
thoughts pressed upon his heart.&nbsp; He passed the door of his
own cottage with resolute steps, however, and went through the
village in search of the man who had engaged to be his
substitute.&nbsp; He found him, told him how the matter stood;
and luckily the man, who had not yet spent the money, was willing
to return it; as there were many others drawn for the militia,
who, he observed, would be glad to give him the same price, or
more, for his services.</p>
<p>The moment Price got the money, he hastened to Mr.
Case&rsquo;s house, walked straight forward into his room, and
laying the money down upon his desk, &ldquo;There, Mr. Attorney,
are your nine guineas; count them; now I have done with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said the attorney, jingling the money
triumphantly in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give you a
taste of the law, my good sir, or I&rsquo;m mistaken.&nbsp; You
forgot the flaw in your lease, which I have safe in this
desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my lease,&rdquo; said the farmer, who had almost
forgot to ask for it till he was thus put in mind of it by the
attorney&rsquo;s imprudent threat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me my lease,
Mr. Case.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve paid my money; you have no right to
keep the lease any longer, whether it is a bad one or a good
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the attorney, locking his desk,
and putting the key into his pocket, &ldquo;possession, my honest
friend,&rdquo; cried he, striking his hand upon the desk,
&ldquo;is nine points of the law.&nbsp; Good night to you.&nbsp;
I cannot in conscience return a lease to a tenant in which I know
there is a capital flaw.&nbsp; It is my duty to show it to my
employer; or, in other words, to your new landlord, whose agent I
have good reasons to expect I shall be; you will live to repent
your obstinacy, Mr. Price.&nbsp; Your servant, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Price retired with melancholy feelings, but not
intimidated.&nbsp; Many a man returns home with a gloomy
countenance, who has not quite so much cause for vexation.</p>
<p>When Susan heard her father&rsquo;s story, she quite forgot
her guinea-hen, and her whole soul was intent upon her poor
mother, who, notwithstanding her utmost exertion, could not
support herself under this sudden stroke of misfortune.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night Susan was called up; her
mother&rsquo;s fever ran high for some hours; but towards morning
it abated, and she fell into a soft sleep with Susan&rsquo;s hand
locked fast in hers.</p>
<p>Susan sat motionless, and breathed softly, lest she should
disturb her.&nbsp; The rushlight, which stood beside the bed, was
now burnt low; the long shadow of the tall wicker chair flitted,
faded, appeared, and vanished, as the flame rose and sunk in the
socket.&nbsp; Susan was afraid that the disagreeable smell might
waken her mother; and, gently disengaging her hand, she went on
tiptoe to extinguish the candle.&nbsp; All was silent: the grey
light of the morning was now spreading over every object; the sun
rose slowly, and Susan stood at the lattice window, looking
through the small leaded, cross-barred panes at the splendid
spectacle.&nbsp; A few birds began to chirp; but, as Susan was
listening to them, her mother started in her sleep, and spoke
unintelligibly.&nbsp; Susan hung up a white apron before the
window to keep out the light, and just then she heard the sound
of music at a distance in the village.&nbsp; As it approached
nearer, she knew that it was Philip playing upon his pipe and
tabor.&nbsp; She distinguished the merry voices of her companions
&ldquo;carolling in honour of the May,&rdquo; and soon she saw
them coming towards her father&rsquo;s cottage, with branches and
garlands in their hands.&nbsp; She opened quick, but gently, the
latch of the door, and ran out to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is!&mdash;here&rsquo;s Susan!&rdquo; they
exclaimed, joyfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the Queen of the
May.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s her crown!&rdquo; cried
Rose, pressing forward; but Susan put her finger upon her lips,
and pointed to her mother&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; Philip&rsquo;s
pipe stopped instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;my mother is ill;
I can&rsquo;t leave her, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then gently
putting aside the crown, her companions bid her say who should
wear it for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you, dear Rose?&rdquo; said she, placing the
garland upon her friend&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
charming May morning,&rdquo; added she, with a smile;
&ldquo;good-bye.&nbsp; We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hear your voices or
the pipe when you have turned the corner into the village; so you
need only stop till then, Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stop for all day,&rdquo; said Philip:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no mind to play any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, poor Susan.&nbsp; It is a pity you
can&rsquo;t come with us,&rdquo; said all the children; and
little Mary ran after Susan to the cottage door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot to thank you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for the
double cowslips; look how pretty they are, and smell how sweet
the violets are in my bosom, and kiss me quick, for I shall be
left behind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Susan kissed the little breathless
girl, and returned softly to the side of her mother&rsquo;s
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How grateful that child is to me, for a cowslip
only!&nbsp; How can I be grateful enough to such a mother as
this?&rdquo; said Susan to herself, as she bent over her sleeping
mother&rsquo;s pale countenance.</p>
<p>Her mother&rsquo;s unfinished knitting lay upon a table near
the bed, and Susan sat down in her wicker arm-chair, and went on
with the row, in the middle of which her hand stopped the
preceding evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;She taught me to knit, she taught
me everything that I know,&rdquo; thought Susan, &ldquo;and the
best of all, she taught me to love her, to wish to be like
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother, when she awakened, felt much refreshed by her
tranquil sleep, and observing that it was a delightful morning,
said, &ldquo;that she had been dreaming she heard music; but that
the drum frightened her, because she thought it was the signal
for her husband to be carried away by a whole regiment of
soldiers, who had pointed their bayonets at him.&nbsp; But that
was but a dream, Susan; I awoke, and knew it was a dream, and I
then fell asleep, and have slept soundly ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How painful it is to awake to the remembrance of
misfortune.&nbsp; Gradually as this poor woman collected her
scattered thoughts, she recalled the circumstances of the
preceding evening.&nbsp; She was too certain that she had heard
from her husband&rsquo;s own lips the words, &ldquo;<i>I must
leave you in three days</i>&rdquo;; and she wished that she could
sleep again, and think it all a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll want, he&rsquo;ll want a hundred
things,&rdquo; said she, starting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must get his
linen ready for him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s very
late.&nbsp; Susan, why did you let me lie so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything shall be ready, dear mother; only
don&rsquo;t hurry yourself,&rdquo; said Susan.&nbsp; And indeed
her mother was ill able to bear any hurry, or to do any work this
day.&nbsp; Susan&rsquo;s affectionate, dexterous, sensible
activity was never more wanted, or more effectual.&nbsp; She
understood so readily, she obeyed so exactly; and when she was
left to her own discretion, judged so prudently, that her mother
had little trouble and no anxiety in directing her.&nbsp; She
said that Susan never did too little, or too much.</p>
<p>Susan was mending her father&rsquo;s linen, when Rose tapped
softly at the window, and beckoned to her to come out.&nbsp; She
went out.&nbsp; &ldquo;How does your mother do, in the first
place?&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well, and I have a little bit of good news
for you besides&mdash;here,&rdquo; said she, pulling out a glove,
in which there was money, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get the guinea-hen
back again&mdash;we have all agreed about it.&nbsp; This is the
money that has been given to us in the village this May
morning.&nbsp; At every door they gave silver.&nbsp; See how
generous they have been&mdash;twelve shillings, I assure
you.&nbsp; Now we are a match for Miss Barbara.&nbsp; You
won&rsquo;t like to leave home; I&rsquo;ll go to Barbara, and you
shall see your guinea-hen in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose hurried away, pleased with her commission, and to
accomplish her business.&nbsp; Miss Barbara&rsquo;s maid Betty
was the first person that was visible at the attorney&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; Rose insisted upon seeing Miss Barbara herself, and
she was shown into a parlour to the young lady, who was reading a
dirty novel, which she put under a heap of law papers as they
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, how you <i>startled</i> me!&nbsp; Is it only
you?&rdquo; said she to her maid; but as soon as she saw Rose
behind the maid, she put on a scornful air. &ldquo;Could not ye
say I was not at home, Betty?&nbsp; Well, my good girl, what
brings you here?&nbsp; Something to borrow or beg, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May every ambassador&mdash;every ambassador in as good a
cause&mdash;answer with as much dignity and moderation as Rose
replied to Barbara upon the present occasion.&nbsp; She assured
her, that the person from whom she came did not send her either
to beg or borrow; that she was able to pay the full value of that
for which she came to ask; and, producing her well filled purse,
&ldquo;I believe that this is a very good shilling,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it, I will change it,
and now you will be so good as to give me Susan&rsquo;s
guinea-hen.&nbsp; It is in her name I ask for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter in whose name you ask for it,&rdquo; replied
Barbara, &ldquo;you will not have it.&nbsp; Take up your
shilling, if you please.&nbsp; I would have taken a shilling
yesterday, if it had been paid at the time properly; but I told
Susan, that if it was not paid then, I should keep the hen, and
so I shall, I promise her.&nbsp; You may go back, and tell her
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attorney&rsquo;s daughter had, whilst Rose opened her
negotiation, measured the depth of her purse with a keen eye; and
her penetration discovered that it contained at least ten
shillings.&nbsp; With proper management she had some hopes that
the guinea-hen might be made to bring in at least half the
money.</p>
<p>Rose, who was of a warm temper, not quite so fit a match as
she had thought herself for the wily Barbara, incautiously
exclaimed, &ldquo;Whatever it costs us, we are determined to have
Susan&rsquo;s favourite hen; so, if one shilling won&rsquo;t do,
take two; and if two won&rsquo;t do, why, take three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shillings sounded provoking upon the table, as she threw
them down one after another, and Barbara coolly replied,
&ldquo;Three won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no conscience, Miss Barbara?&nbsp; Then take
four.&rdquo;&nbsp; Barbara shook her head.&nbsp; A fifth shilling
was instantly proffered; but Bab, who now saw plainly that she
had the game in her own hands, preserved a cold, cruel
silence.&nbsp; Rose went on rapidly, bidding shilling after
shilling, till she had completely emptied her purse.&nbsp; The
twelve shillings were spread upon the table.&nbsp;
Barbara&rsquo;s avarice was moved, she consented for this ransom
to liberate her prisoner.</p>
<p>Rose pushed the money towards her; but just then, recollecting
that she was acting for others more than for herself, and
doubting whether she had full powers to conclude such an
extravagant bargain, she gathered up the public treasure, and
with newly-recovered prudence observed that she must go back to
consult her friends.&nbsp; Her generous little friends were
amazed at Barbara&rsquo;s meanness, but with one accord declared
that they were most willing, for their parts, to give up every
farthing of the money.&nbsp; They all went to Susan in a body,
and told her so.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s our purse,&rdquo;
said they; &ldquo;do what you please with it.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
would not wait for one word of thanks, but ran away, leaving only
Rose with her to settle the treaty for the guinea-hen.</p>
<p>There is a certain manner of accepting a favour, which shows
true generosity of mind.&nbsp; Many know how to give, but few
know how to accept a gift properly.&nbsp; Susan was touched, but
not astonished, by the kindness of her young friends, and she
received the purse with as much simplicity as she would have
given it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rose, &ldquo;shall I go back for the
guinea-hen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guinea-hen!&rdquo; said Susan, starting from a
reverie into which she had fallen, as she contemplated the
purse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly I <i>do</i> long to see my pretty
guinea-hen once more; but I was not thinking of her just
then&mdash;I was thinking of my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Susan had heard her mother often, in the course of this
day, wish that she had but money enough in the world to pay John
Simpson for going to serve in the militia instead of her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;This, to be sure, will go but a little
way,&rdquo; thought Susan; &ldquo;but still it may be of some use
to my father.&rdquo;&nbsp; She told her mind to Rose, and
concluded by saying, decidedly, that &ldquo;if the money was
given to her to dispose of as she pleased, she would give it to
her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all yours, my dear, good Susan,&rdquo; cried
Rose, with a look of warm approbation.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is so
like you&mdash;but I&rsquo;m sorry that Miss Bab must keep your
guinea-hen.&nbsp; I would not be her for all the guinea-hens, or
guineas either, in the whole world.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll answer
for it, the guinea-hen won&rsquo;t make her happy, and
you&rsquo;ll be happy <i>even</i> without; because you are
good.&nbsp; Let me come and help you to-morrow,&rdquo; continued
she, looking at Susan&rsquo;s work, &ldquo;if you have any more
mending work to do&mdash;I never liked work till I worked with
you.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t forget my thimble or my scissors,&rdquo;
added she, laughing&mdash;&ldquo;though I used to forget them
when I was a giddy girl.&nbsp; I assure you I am a great hand at
my needle, now&mdash;try me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of
her needle, and that she would most willingly accept of her
services, but that <i>unluckily</i> she had finished all the
needle work immediately wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I shall have a
great deal of business to-morrow; but I won&rsquo;t tell you what
it is that I have to do, for I am afraid I shall not succeed; but
if I do succeed, I&rsquo;ll come and tell you directly, because
you will be so glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan, who had always been attentive to what her mother taught
her, and who had often assisted her when she was baking bread and
cakes for the family at the Abbey, had now formed the courageous,
but not presumptuous idea, that she could herself undertake to
bake a batch of bread.&nbsp; One of the servants from the Abbey
had been sent all round the village in the morning in search of
bread, and had not been able to procure any that was
tolerable.&nbsp; Mrs. Price&rsquo;s last baking failed for want
of good barm.&nbsp; She was not now strong enough to attempt
another herself; and when the brewer&rsquo;s boy came with
eagerness to tell her that he had some fine fresh yeast, she
thanked him, but sighed, and said it would be of no use to
her.&nbsp; Accordingly she went to work with much prudent care,
and when her bread the next morning came out of the oven, it was
excellent; at least her mother said so, and she was a good
judge.&nbsp; It was sent to the Abbey; and as the family there
had not tasted any good bread since their arrival in the country,
they also were earnest and warm in its praise.&nbsp; Inquiries
were made from the housekeeper, and they heard, with some
surprise, that this excellent bread was made by a young girl only
twelve years old.</p>
<p>The housekeeper, who had known Susan from a child, was pleased
to have an opportunity in speaking in her favour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is the most industrious little creature, ma&rsquo;am,
in the world,&rdquo; said she to her mistress.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Little I can&rsquo;t so well call her now, since
she&rsquo;s grown tall and slender to look at; and glad I am she
is grown up likely to look at; for handsome is that handsome
does; she thinks no more of her being handsome than I do myself;
yet she has as proper a respect for herself, ma&rsquo;am, as you
have; and I always see her neat, and with her mother,
ma&rsquo;am, or fit people, as a girl should be.&nbsp; As for her
mother, she dotes upon her, as well she may; for I should myself
if I had half such a daughter; and then she has two little
brothers; and she&rsquo;s as good to them, and, my boy Philip
says, taught &rsquo;em to read more than the school-mistress, all
with tenderness and good nature; but, I beg your pardon,
ma&rsquo;am, I cannot stop myself when I once begin to talk of
Susan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have really said enough to excite my
curiosity,&rdquo; said her mistress; &ldquo;pray send for her
immediately; we can see her before we go out to walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benevolent housekeeper despatched her boy Philip for
Susan, who never happened to be in such an <i>untidy</i> state as
to be unable to obey a summons without a long preparation.&nbsp;
She had, it is true, been very busy; but orderly people can be
busy and neat at the same time.&nbsp; She put on her usual straw
hat, and accompanied Rose&rsquo;s mother, who was going with a
basket of cleared muslin to the Abbey.</p>
<p>The modest simplicity of Susan&rsquo;s appearance and the
artless propriety of the answers she gave to all the questions
that were asked her, pleased the ladies at the Abbey, who were
good judges of character and manners.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Somers had two sisters, sensible, benevolent
women.&nbsp; They were not of that race of fine ladies who are
miserable the moment they come to <i>the country</i>; nor yet
were they of that bustling sort, who quack and direct all their
poor neighbours, for the mere love of managing, or the want of
something to do.&nbsp; They were judiciously generous; and whilst
they wished to diffuse happiness, they were not peremptory in
requiring that people should be happy precisely their own
way.&nbsp; With these dispositions, and with a well informed
brother, who, though he never wished to direct, was always
willing to assist in their efforts to do good, there were
reasonable hopes that these ladies would be a blessing to the
poor villagers amongst whom they were now settled.</p>
<p>As soon as Miss Somers had spoken to Susan, she inquired for
her brother; but Sir Arthur was in his study, and a gentleman was
with him on business.</p>
<p>Susan was desirous of returning to her mother, and the ladies
therefore would not detain her.&nbsp; Miss Somers told her, with
a smile, when she took leave, that she would call upon her in the
evening at six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>It was impossible that such a grand event as Susan&rsquo;s
visit to the Abbey could long remain unknown to Barbara Case and
her gossiping maid.&nbsp; They watched eagerly for the moment of
her return, that they might satisfy their curiosity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There she is, I declare, just come into her garden,&rdquo;
cried Bab; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run in and get it all out of her in
a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bab could descend, without shame, whenever it suited her
purposes, from the height of insolent pride to the lowest
meanness of fawning familiarity.</p>
<p>Susan was gathering some marigolds and some parsley for her
mother&rsquo;s broth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Susan,&rdquo; said Bab, who came close up to her
before she perceived it, &ldquo;how goes the world with you
to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother is rather better to-day, she says,
ma&rsquo;am&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; replies Susan, coldly but
civilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ma&rsquo;am</i>! dear, how polite we are grown of a
sudden!&rdquo; cried Bab, winking at her maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
may see you&rsquo;ve been in good company this morning&mdash;hey,
Susan?&nbsp; Come, let&rsquo;s hear about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the ladies themselves, or was it only the
housekeeper sent for you?&rdquo; said the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What room did you go into?&rdquo; continued Bab.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you see Miss Somers, or Sir Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Somers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;La! she saw Miss Somers!&nbsp; Betty, I must hear about
it.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you stop gathering those things for a
minute, and chat a bit with us, Susan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay, indeed, Miss Barbara; for my
mother&rsquo;s broth is just wanted, and I&rsquo;m in a
hurry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Susan ran home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, her head is full of broth now,&rdquo; said Bab to
her maid; &ldquo;and she has not a word for herself, though she
has been abroad.&nbsp; My papa may well call her <i>Simple
Susan</i>; for simple she is, and simple she will be, all the
world over.&nbsp; For my part, I think she&rsquo;s little better
than a downright simpleton.&nbsp; But, however, simple or not,
I&rsquo;ll get what I want out of her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be able
to speak, maybe, when she has settled the grand matter of the
broth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll step in and ask to see her mother, that
will put her in a good humour in a trice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbara followed Susan into the cottage, and found her
occupied with the grand affair of the broth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
ready?&rdquo; said Bab, peeping into the pot that was over the
fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear, how savoury it smells!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
wait till you go in with it to your mother; for I must ask her
how she does myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please to sit down then, miss,&rdquo; said
Simple Susan, with a smile; for at this instant she forgot the
guinea-hen; &ldquo;I have but just put the parsley into the
broth; but it soon will be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this interval Bab employed herself, much to her own
satisfaction, in cross-questioning Susan.&nbsp; She was rather
provoked indeed that she could not learn exactly how each of the
ladies was dressed, and what there was to be for dinner at the
Abbey; and she was curious beyond measure to find out what Miss
Somers meant, by saying that she would call at Mr. Price&rsquo;s
cottage at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do
you think she could mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she meant what she said,&rdquo; replied
Susan, &ldquo;that she would come here at six
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s as plain as a pike-staff,&rdquo; said
Barbara; &ldquo;but what else did she mean, think you?&nbsp;
People, you know, don&rsquo;t always mean exactly, downright,
neither more nor less than what they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said Susan, with an arch smile,
which convinced Barbara that she was not quite a simpleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Not Always</i>,&rdquo; repeated Barbara
colouring,&mdash;&ldquo;oh, then I suppose you have some guess at
what Miss Somers meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;I was not thinking about
Miss Somers, when I said not always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice that broth does look,&rdquo; resumed Barbara,
after a pause.</p>
<p>Susan had now poured the broth into a basin, and as she
strewed over it the bright orange marigolds, it looked very
tempting.&nbsp; She tasted it, and added now a little salt, and
now a little more, till she thought it was just to her
mother&rsquo;s taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>I</i> must taste it,&rdquo; said Bab, taking the
basin up greedily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a spoon?&rdquo; said Susan,
trembling at the large mouthfuls which Barbara sucked up with a
terrible noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a spoonful, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Barbara,
setting down the basin in high anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;The next time
I taste your broth you shall affront me, if you dare!&nbsp; The
next time I set my foot in this house, you shall be as saucy to
me as you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she flounced out of the house,
repeating &ldquo;<i>Take a spoon</i>, <i>pig</i>, was what you
meant to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan stood in amazement at the beginning of this speech; but
the concluding words explained to her the mystery.</p>
<p>Some years before this time, when Susan was a very little
girl, and could scarcely speak plain, as she was eating a basin
of bread and milk for her supper at the cottage door, a great pig
came up, and put his nose into the basin.&nbsp; Susan was willing
that the pig should have some share of the bread and milk; but as
she ate with a spoon and he with his large mouth, she presently
discovered that he was likely to have more than his share; and in
a simple tone of expostulation she said to him, &ldquo;Take a
<i>poon</i>, pig.&rdquo; <a name="citation77"></a><a
href="#footnote77" class="citation">[77]</a>&nbsp; The saying
become proverbial in the village.&nbsp; Susan&rsquo;s little
companions repeated it, and applied it upon many occasions,
whenever anyone claimed more than his share of anything
good.&nbsp; Barbara, who was then not Miss Barbara, but plain
Bab, and who had played with all the poor children in the
neighbourhood, was often reproved in her unjust methods of
division by Susan&rsquo;s proverb.&nbsp; Susan, as she grew up,
forgot the childish saying; but the remembrance of it rankled in
Barbara&rsquo;s mind, and it was to this that she suspected Susan
had alluded, when she recommended a spoon to her, whilst she was
swallowing the basin of broth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La, miss,&rdquo; said Barbara&rsquo;s maid, when she
found her mistress in a passion upon her return from
Susan&rsquo;s, &ldquo;I only wondered you did her the honour to
set your foot within her doors.&nbsp; What need have you to
trouble her for news about the Abbey folks, when your own papa
has been there all the morning, and is just come in, and can tell
you everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbara did not know that her father meant to go to the Abbey
that morning, for Attorney Case was mysterious even to his own
family about his morning rides.&nbsp; He never chose to be asked
where he was going, or where he had been; and this made his
servants more than commonly inquisitive to trace him.</p>
<p>Barbara, against whose apparent childishness and real cunning
he was not sufficiently on his guard, had often the art of
drawing him into conversation about his visits.&nbsp; She ran
into her father&rsquo;s parlour; but she knew, the moment she saw
his face, that it was no time to ask questions; his pen was
across his mouth, and his brown wig pushed oblique upon his
contracted forehead.&nbsp; The wig was always pushed crooked
whenever he was in a brown or rather, a black study.&nbsp;
Barbara, who did not, like Susan, bear with her father&rsquo;s
testy humour from affection and gentleness of disposition, but
who always humoured him from artifice, tried all her skill to
fathom his thoughts, and when she found that it would not do, she
went to tell her maid so, and to complain that her father was so
cross there was no bearing him.</p>
<p>It is true that Attorney Case was not in the happiest mood
possible; for he was by no means satisfied with his
morning&rsquo;s work at the Abbey.&nbsp; Sir Arthur Somers, the
<i>new man</i>, did not suit him, and he began to be rather
apprehensive that he should not suit Sir Arthur.&nbsp; He had
sound reasons for his doubts.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Somers was an excellent lawyer, and a perfectly
honest man.&nbsp; This seemed to our attorney a contradiction in
terms; in the course of his practice the case had not occurred;
and he had no precedents ready to direct his proceedings.&nbsp;
Sir Arthur was also a man of wit and eloquence, yet of plain
dealing and humanity.&nbsp; The attorney could not persuade
himself to believe that his benevolence was anything but
enlightened cunning, and his plain dealing he one minute dreaded
as the masterpiece of art, and the next despised as the
characteristic of folly.&nbsp; In short, he had not yet decided
whether he was an honest man or a knave.&nbsp; He had settled
accounts with him for his late agency, and had talked about
sundry matters of business.&nbsp; He constantly perceived,
however, that he could not impose upon Sir Arthur; but the idea
that he could know all the mazes of the law, and yet prefer the
straight road, was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Mr. Case, having paid Sir Arthur some compliments on his great
legal abilities, and his high reputation at the bar, he coolly
replied, &ldquo;I have left the bar.&rdquo;&nbsp; The attorney
looked in unfeigned astonishment, that a man who was actually
making 3,000 pounds per annum at the bar should leave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am come,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, &ldquo;to enjoy that
kind of domestic life in the country which I prefer to all
others, and amongst people whose happiness I hope to
increase.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this speech the attorney changed his
ground, flattering himself that he should find his man averse to
business, and ignorant of country affairs.&nbsp; He talked of the
value of land, and of new leases.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur wished to enlarge his domain, and to make a ride
round it.&nbsp; A map of it was lying upon the table, and Farmer
Price&rsquo;s garden came exactly across the new road for the
ride.&nbsp; Sir Arthur looked disappointed; and the keen attorney
seized the moment to inform him that &ldquo;Price&rsquo;s whole
land was at his disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At my disposal! how so?&rdquo; cried Sir Arthur,
eagerly; &ldquo;it will not be out of lease, I believe, these ten
years.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look into the rent roll again; perhaps I
am mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, my good sir, and you are not
mistaken,&rdquo; said Mr. Case, with a shrewd smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In one sense, the land will not be out of lease these ten
years, and in another it is out of lease at this present
time.&nbsp; To come to the point at once, the lease is, ab
origine, null and void.&nbsp; I have detected a capital flaw in
the body of it.&nbsp; I pledge my credit upon it, sir, it
can&rsquo;t stand a single term in law or equity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attorney observed, that at these words Sir Arthur&rsquo;s
eye was fixed with a look of earnest attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
I have him,&rdquo; said the cunning tempter to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither in law nor equity,&rdquo; repeated Sir Arthur,
with apparent incredulity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you sure of that, Mr.
Case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&nbsp; As I told you before, sir, I&rsquo;d pledge
my whole credit upon the thing&mdash;I&rsquo;d stake my
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s something</i>,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur,
as if he was pondering upon the matter.</p>
<p>The attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man, who
sees a chance at one stroke of winning a rich friend, and of
ruining a poor enemy.&nbsp; He explained, with legal volubility
and technical amplification, the nature of the mistake in Mr.
Price&rsquo;s lease.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was, sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;a lease for the life of Peter Price, Susanna his wife, and
to the survivor or survivors of them, or for the full time and
term of twenty years, to be computed from the first day of May
then next ensuing.&nbsp; Now, sir, this, you see, is a lease in
reversion, which the late Sir Benjamin Somers had not, by his
settlement, a right to make.&nbsp; This is a curious mistake, you
see, Sir Arthur; and in filling up those printed leases
there&rsquo;s always a good chance of some flaw.&nbsp; I find it
perpetually; but I never found a better than this in the whole
course of my practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Arthur stood in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the attorney, taking him by
the button, &ldquo;you have no scruple of stirring in this
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, that can be done away in a moment.&nbsp;
Your name shall not appear in it at all.&nbsp; You have nothing
to do but to make over the lease to me.&nbsp; I make all safe to
you with my bond.&nbsp; Now, being in possession, I come forward
in my own proper person.&nbsp; <i>Shall I proceed</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;you have said enough,&rdquo; replied Sir
Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case, indeed, lies in a nutshell,&rdquo; said the
attorney, who had by this time worked himself up to such a pitch
of professional enthusiasm, that, intent upon his vision of a
lawsuit, he totally forgot to observe the impression his words
made upon Sir Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing we have forgotten all this
time,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can that be, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we shall ruin this poor man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Case was thunderstruck at these words, or rather, by the look
which accompanied them.&nbsp; He recollected that he had laid
himself open before he was sure of Sir Arthur&rsquo;s <i>real</i>
character.&nbsp; He softened, and said he should have had
certainly more <i>consideration</i> in the case of any but a
litigious, pig-headed fellow, as he knew Price to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he be litigious,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, &ldquo;I
shall certainly be glad to get him fairly out of the parish as
soon as possible.&nbsp; When you go home, you will be so good,
sir, as to send me his lease, that I may satisfy myself before we
stir in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attorney, brightening up, prepared to take leave; but he
could not persuade himself to take his departure without making
one push at Sir Arthur about the agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not trouble <i>you</i>, Sir Arthur, with this
lease of Price&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Case; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave
it with your agent.&nbsp; Whom shall I apply to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>To myself</i>, sir, if you please,&rdquo; replied
Sir Arthur.</p>
<p>The courtiers of Louis the Fourteenth could not have looked
more astounded than our attorney, when they received from their
monarch a similar answer.&nbsp; It was this unexpected reply of
Sir Arthur&rsquo;s which had deranged the temper of Mr. Case, and
caused his wig to stand so crooked upon his forehead, and which
had rendered him impenetrably silent to his inquisitive daughter
Barbara.</p>
<p>After having walked up and down his room, conversing with
himself, for some time, the attorney concluded that the agency
must be given to somebody when Sir Arthur should have to attend
his duty in Parliament; that the agency, even for the winter
season, was not a thing to be neglected; and that, if he managed
well, he might yet secure it for himself.&nbsp; He had often
found that small timely presents worked wonderfully upon his own
mind, and he judged of others by himself.&nbsp; The tenants had
been in the reluctant but constant practice of making him
continual petty offerings; and he resolved to try the same course
with Sir Arthur, whose resolution to be his own agent, he
thought, argued a close, saving, avaricious disposition.&nbsp; He
had heard the housekeeper at the Abbey inquiring, as he passed
through the servants, whether there was any lamb to be
gotten?&nbsp; She said that Sir Arthur was remarkably fond of
lamb, and that she wished she could get a quarter for him.&nbsp;
Immediately he sallied into his kitchen, as soon as the idea
struck him, and asked a shepherd, who was waiting there, whether
he knew of a nice fat lamb to be had anywhere in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of one,&rdquo; cried Barbara.&nbsp; &ldquo;Susan
Price has a pet lamb that&rsquo;s as fat as fat could
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; The attorney easily caught at these words, and
speedily devised a scheme for obtaining Susan&rsquo;s lamb for
nothing.</p>
<p>It would be something strange if an attorney of his talents
and standing was not an over-match for Simple Susan.&nbsp; He
prowled forth in search of his prey.&nbsp; He found Susan packing
up her father&rsquo;s little wardrobe; and when she looked up as
she knelt, he saw that she had been in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your mother to-day, Susan?&rdquo; inquired the
attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse, sir.&nbsp; My father goes to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; said Susan, with a
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped&mdash;how do you know
that?&rdquo; said Case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, <i>dear</i> sir!&rdquo; cried she, looking up at
him, and a sudden ray of hope beamed in her ingenuous
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if <i>you</i> could help it, Susan?&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; Susan clasped her hands in silence, more expressive
than words.&nbsp; &ldquo;You <i>can</i> help it,
Susan.&rdquo;&nbsp; She started up in an ecstasy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What would you give now to have your father at home for a
whole week longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything!&mdash;but I have nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you have, a lamb,&rdquo; said the hard-hearted
attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor little lamb!&rdquo; said Susan; &ldquo;but what
can that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good can any lamb do?&nbsp; Is not lamb good to
eat?&nbsp; Why do you look so pale, girl?&nbsp; Are not sheep
killed every day, and don&rsquo;t you eat mutton?&nbsp; Is your
lamb better than anybody else&rsquo;s, think you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;but I
love it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More fool you,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feeds out of hand, it follows me about; I have
always taken care of it; my mother gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say no more about it, then,&rdquo; he cynically
observed; &ldquo;if you love your lamb better than both your
father and your mother, keep it, and good morning to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, oh stay!&rdquo; cried Susan, catching the skirt
of his coat with an eager, trembling hand;&mdash;&ldquo;a whole
week, did you say?&nbsp; My mother may get better in that
time.&nbsp; No, I do not love my lamb half so well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The struggle of her mind ceased, and with a placid countenance
and calm voice, &ldquo;take the lamb,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; said the attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grazing in the meadow, by the river side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be brought up before night-fall for the
butcher, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not forget it,&rdquo; said Susan, steadily.</p>
<p>As soon, however, as her persecutor turned his back and
quitted the house, Susan sat down, and hid her face in her
hands.&nbsp; She was soon aroused by the sound of her
mother&rsquo;s feeble voice, who was calling Susan from the inner
room where she lay.&nbsp; Susan went in; but did not undraw the
curtain as she stood beside the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there, love?&nbsp; Undraw the curtain, that I
may see you, and tell me;&mdash;I thought I heard some strange
voice just now talking to my child.&nbsp; Something&rsquo;s
amiss, Susan,&rdquo; said her mother, raising herself as well as
she was able in the bed, to examine her daughter&rsquo;s
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you think it amiss, then, my dear mother,&rdquo;
said Susan, stooping to kiss her&mdash;&ldquo;would you think it
amiss, if my father was to stay with us a week longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan! you don&rsquo;t say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, indeed, a whole week;&mdash;but how burning hot
your hand is still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure he will stay?&rdquo; inquired her
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you know?&nbsp; Who told you
so?&nbsp; Tell me all quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attorney Case told me so; he can get him a week&rsquo;s
longer leave of absence, and he has promised he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless him for it, for ever and ever!&rdquo; said
the poor woman, joining her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;May the blessing
of heaven be with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan closed the curtains, and was silent.&nbsp; She <i>could
not say Amen</i>.&nbsp; She was called out of the room at this
moment, for a messenger was come from the Abbey for the
bread-bills.&nbsp; It was she who always made out the bills, for
though she had not a great number of lessons from the
writing-master, she had taken so much pains to learn that she
could write a very neat, legible hand, and she found this very
useful.&nbsp; She was not, to be sure, particularly inclined to
draw out a long bill at this instant, but business must be
done.&nbsp; She set to work, ruled her lines for the pounds,
shillings and pence, made out the bill for the Abbey, and
despatched the impatient messenger.&nbsp; She then resolved to
make out all the bills for the neighbours, who had many of them
taken a few loaves and rolls of her baking.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had
better get all my business finished,&rdquo; said she to herself,
&ldquo;before I go down to the meadow to take leave of my poor
lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was sooner said than done, for she found that she had a
great number of bills to write, and the slate on which she had
entered the account was not immediately to be found; and when it
was found the figures were almost rubbed out.&nbsp; Barbara had
sat down upon it.&nbsp; Susan pored over the number of loaves,
and the names of the persons who took them; and she wrote and
cast up sums, and corrected and re-corrected them, till her head
grew quite puzzled.</p>
<p>The table was covered with little square bits of paper, on
which she had been writing bills over and over again, when her
father came in with a bill in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
this, Susan?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can ye be so
careless, child?&nbsp; What is your head running upon?&nbsp;
Here, look at the bill you were sending up to the Abbey?&nbsp; I
met the messenger, and luckily asked to see how much it
was.&nbsp; Look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan looked and blushed; it was written, &ldquo;Sir Arthur
Somers, to John Price, debtor, six dozen <i>lambs</i>, so
much.&rdquo;&nbsp; She altered it, and returned it to her father;
but he had taken up some of the papers which lay upon the
table.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are all these, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them are wrong, and I&rsquo;ve written them out
again,&rdquo; said Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them!&nbsp; All of them, I think, seem to be
wrong, if I can read,&rdquo; said her father, rather angrily, and
he pointed out to her sundry strange mistakes.&nbsp; Her head,
indeed, had been running upon her poor lamb.&nbsp; She corrected
all the mistakes with so much patience, and bore to be blamed
with so much good humour, that her father at last said, that it
was impossible ever to scold Susan, without being in the wrong at
the last.</p>
<p>As soon as all was set right, Price took the bills, and said
he would go round to the neighbours, and collect the money
himself; for that he should be very proud to have it to say to
them, that it was all earned by his own little daughter.</p>
<p>Susan resolved to keep the pleasure of telling him of his
week&rsquo;s reprieve till he should come home to sup, as he had
promised to do, in her mother&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; She was not
sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the knapsack, which she had
been packing up for his journey.&nbsp; &ldquo;How delighted he
will be when he hears the good news!&rdquo; said she, to herself;
&ldquo;but I know he will be a little sorry too for my poor
lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Susan had now settled all her business, she thought she
could have time to go down to the meadow by the river side to see
her favourite; but just as she had tied on her straw hat the
village clock struck four, and this was the hour at which she
always went to fetch her little brothers home from a dame-school
near the village.&nbsp; She knew that they would be disappointed,
if she was later than usual, and she did not like to keep them
waiting, because they were very patient, good boys; so she put
off the visit to her lamb, and went immediately for her
brothers.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Ev&rsquo;n in the spring and playtime of the

That calls th&rsquo; unwonted villager abroad,<br />
With all her little ones, a sportive train,<br />
To gather king-cups in the yellow mead,<br />

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dame-school, which was about a
mile from the hamlet, was not a showy edifice; but it was
reverenced as much by the young race of village scholars as if it
had been the most stately mansion in the land; it was a low
roofed, long, thatched tenement, sheltered by a few reverend
oaks, under which many generations of hopeful children had
gambolled in their turn.</p>
<p>The close shaven green, which sloped down from the hatch-door
of the schoolroom, was paled round with a rude paling, which,
though decayed in some parts by time, was not in any place broken
by violence.</p>
<p>The place bespoke order and peace.&nbsp; The dame who governed
was well obeyed, because she was just and well beloved, and
because she was ever glad to give well earned praise and pleasure
to her little subjects.</p>
<p>Susan had once been under her gentle dominion, and had been
deservedly her favourite scholar.&nbsp; The dame often cited her
as the best example to the succeeding tribe of emulous
youngsters.&nbsp; She had scarcely opened the wicket which
separated the green before the schoolroom door from the lane,
when she heard the merry voices of the children, and saw the
little troup issuing from the hatchway, and spreading over the
green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s Susan!&rdquo; cried her two little
brothers, running, leaping, and bounding up to her; and many of
the other rosy girls and boys crowded round her, to talk of their
plays; for Susan was easily interested in all that made others
happy; but she could not make them comprehend, that, if they all
spoke at once it was not possible that she could hear what was
said.</p>
<p>The voices were still raised one above another, all eager to
establish some important observation about ninepins, or marbles,
or tops, or bows and arrows, when suddenly music was heard and
the crowd was silenced.&nbsp; The music seemed to be near the
spot where the children were standing, and they looked round to
see whence it could come.&nbsp; Susan pointed to the great
oak-tree, and they beheld, seated under its shade, an old man
playing upon his harp.&nbsp; The children all approached&mdash;at
first timidly, for the sounds were solemn; but as the harper
heard their little footsteps coming towards him, he changed his
hand and played one of his most lively tunes.&nbsp; The circle
closed, and pressed nearer and nearer to him; some who were in
the foremost row whispered to each other, &ldquo;He is
blind!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; and &ldquo;He
looks very poor,&mdash;what a ragged coat he wears!&rdquo; said
others.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must be very old, for all his hair is
white; and he must have travelled a great way, for his shoes are
quite worn out,&rdquo; observed another.</p>
<p>All these remarks were made whilst he was tuning his harp, for
when he once more began to play, not a word was uttered.&nbsp; He
seemed pleased by their simple exclamations of wonder and
delight, and, eager to amuse his young audience, he played now a
gay and now a pathetic air, to suit their several humours.</p>
<p>Susan&rsquo;s voice, which was soft and sweet, expressive of
gentleness and good nature, caught his ear the moment she
spoke.&nbsp; He turned his face eagerly to the place where she
stood; and it was observed, that whenever she said that she liked
any tune particularly he played it over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am blind,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and cannot
see your faces; but I know you all asunder by your voices, and I
can guess pretty well at all your humours and characters by your
voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you so, indeed?&rdquo; cried Susan&rsquo;s little
brother William, who had stationed himself between the old
man&rsquo;s knees.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you heard <i>my</i> sister
Susan speak just now.&nbsp; Can you tell us what sort of person
she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can, I think, without being a conjurer,&rdquo;
said the old man, lifting the boy up on his knee;
&ldquo;<i>your</i> sister Susan is good-natured.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
boy clapped his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
good-tempered.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Right</i>,&rdquo; said
little William, with a louder clap of applause.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
very fond of the little boy who sits upon my knee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;O right! right! quite right!&rdquo; exclaimed the child,
and &ldquo;quite right&rdquo; echoed on all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how came you to know so much, when you are
blind?&rdquo; said William, examining the old man
attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said John, who was a year older than his
brother, and very sage, &ldquo;you should not put him in mind of
his being blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I am blind,&rdquo; said the harper, &ldquo;I can
hear, you know, and I heard from your sister herself all that I
told you of her, that she was good-tempered and good-natured and
fond of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;you did not hear all that
from herself, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;for nobody
ever hears her praising herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did not I hear her tell you,&rdquo; said the harper,
&ldquo;when you first came round me, that she was in a great
hurry to go home, but that she would stay a little while, since
you wished it so much?&nbsp; Was not that good-natured?&nbsp; And
when you said you did not like the tune she liked best, she was
not angry with you, but said, &lsquo;Then play William&rsquo;s
first, if you please,&rsquo;&mdash;was not that
good-tempered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; interrupted William, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all
true; but how did you find out that she was fond of
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is such a difficult question,&rdquo; said the
harper, &ldquo;that I must take time to consider.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The harper tuned his instrument, as he pondered, or seemed to
ponder: and at this instant, two boys who had been searching for
birds&rsquo; nests in the hedges, and who had heard the sound of
the harp, came blustering up, and pushing their way through the
circle, one of them exclaimed, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on
here?&nbsp; Who are you, my old fellow?&nbsp; A blind
harper!&nbsp; Well, play us a tune, if you can play ever a good
one&mdash;play me&mdash;let&rsquo;s see, what shall he play,
Bob?&rdquo; added he turning to his companion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bumper Squire Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, though he did not seem quite pleased with the
peremptory manner of the request, played, as he was desired,
&ldquo;Bumper Squire Jones&rdquo;; and several other tunes were
afterwards bespoke by the same rough and tyrannical voice.</p>
<p>The little children shrunk back in timid silence, and eyed the
brutal boy with dislike.&nbsp; This boy was the son of Attorney
Case; and as his father had neglected to correct his temper when
he was a child, as he grew up it became insufferable.&nbsp; All
who were younger and weaker than himself, dreaded his approach,
and detested him as a tyrant.</p>
<p>When the old harper was so tired that he could play no more, a
lad, who usually carried his harp for him, and who was within
call, came up, and held his master&rsquo;s hat to the company,
saying, &ldquo;Will you be pleased to remember us?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The children readily produced their halfpence, and thought their
wealth well bestowed upon this poor, good-natured man, who had
taken so much pains to entertain them, better even than upon the
gingerbread woman, whose stall they loved to frequent.&nbsp; The
hat was held some time to the attorney&rsquo;s son before he
chose to see it.&nbsp; At last he put his hand surlily into his
waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling. There were
sixpennyworth of halfpence in the hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take these halfpence,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and here&rsquo;s a
shilling for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, sir,&rdquo; said the lad; but as he took
the shilling which the young gentleman had slily put <i>into the
blind man&rsquo;s hand</i>, he saw that it was not worth one
farthing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid it is not good, sir,&rdquo;
said the lad, whose business it was to examine the money for his
master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, then, you&rsquo;ll get no other,&rdquo;
said young Case, with an insulting laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never will do, sir,&rdquo; persisted the lad;
&ldquo;look at it yourself; the edges are all yellow! you can see
the copper through it quite plain.&nbsp; Sir, nobody will take it
from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair,&rdquo; said the brutal boy,
pushing away his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may pass it, you know, as
well as I do, if you look sharp.&nbsp; You have taken it from me,
and I shan&rsquo;t take it back again, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A whisper of &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very unjust,&rdquo; was
heard.&nbsp; The little assembly, though under evident
constraint, could no longer suppress their indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says it&rsquo;s unjust?&rdquo; cried the tyrant,
sternly, looking down upon his judges.</p>
<p>Susan&rsquo;s little brothers had held her gown fast, to
prevent her from moving at the beginning of this contest, and she
was now so much interested to see the end of it, that she stood
still, without making any resistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anyone here amongst yourselves a judge of
silver?&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s the butcher&rsquo;s boy,&rdquo; said
the attorney&rsquo;s son; &ldquo;show it to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was a sickly-looking boy, and of a remarkably peaceful
disposition.&nbsp; Young Case fancied that he would be afraid to
give judgment against him.&nbsp; However, after some
moments&rsquo; hesitation, and after turning the shilling round
several times, he pronounced, &ldquo;that, as far as his judgment
went, but he did not pretend to be a downright <i>certain
sure</i> of it, the shilling was not over and above
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then to Susan, to screen himself from manifest
danger, for the attorney&rsquo;s son looked upon him with a
vengeful mien, &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s Susan here, who
understands silver a great deal better than I do; she takes a
power of it for bread, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to her,&rdquo; said the old harper;
&ldquo;if she says the shilling is good, keep it,
Jack.&rdquo;&nbsp; The shilling was handed to Susan, who, though
she had with becoming modesty forborne all interference, did not
hesitate, when she was called upon, to speak the truth: &ldquo;I
think that this shilling is a bad one,&rdquo; said she; and the
gentle but firm tone in which she pronounced the words, for a
moment awed and silenced the angry and brutal boy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another, then,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;I
have sixpences and shillings too in plenty, thank my
stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan now walked away with her two little brothers, and all
the other children separated to go to their several homes.&nbsp;
The old harper called to Susan, and begged, that, if she was
going towards the village, she would be so kind as to show him
the way.&nbsp; His lad took up his harp, and little William took
the old man by the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead him, I can
lead him,&rdquo; said he; and John ran on before them, to gather
king-cups in the meadow.</p>
<p>There was a small rivulet, which they had to cross, and as a
plank which served for a bridge over it was rather narrow, Susan
was afraid to trust the old blind man to his little conductor;
she therefore went on the tottering plank first herself, and then
led the old harper carefully over.&nbsp; They were now come to a
gate, which opened upon the high road to the village.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is the high road straight before you,&rdquo; said
Susan to the lad, who was carrying his master&rsquo;s harp;
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t miss it.&nbsp; Now I must bid you a good
evening; for I&rsquo;m in a great hurry to get home, and must go
the short way across the fields here, which would not be so
pleasant for you, because of the stiles.&nbsp;
Good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old harper thanked her, and went along
the high road, whilst she and her brothers tripped on as fast as
they could by the short way across the fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Somers, I am afraid, will be waiting for
us,&rdquo; said Susan.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know she said she would
call at six; and by the length of our shadows I&rsquo;m sure it
is late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came to their own cottage-door, they heard many
voices, and they saw, when they entered, several ladies standing
in the kitchen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in, Susan; we thought you had
quite forsaken us,&rdquo; said Miss Somers to Susan, who advanced
timidly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fancy you forgot that we promised to pay
you a visit this evening, but you need not blush so much about
the matter; there is no great harm done; we have only been here
about five minutes; and we have been well employed in admiring
your neat garden, and your orderly shelves.&nbsp; Is it you,
Susan, who keeps these things in such nice order?&rdquo;
continued Miss Somers, looking round the kitchen.</p>
<p>Before Susan could reply, little William pushed forward, and
answered, &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, it is <i>my</i> sister Susan
that keeps everything neat; and she always comes to school for
us, too, which was what caused her to be so late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because as how,&rdquo; continued John, &ldquo;she was
loth to refuse us the hearing a blind man play on the harp.&nbsp;
It was we kept her, and we hopes, ma&rsquo;am, as you
<i>are</i>&mdash;as you <i>seem</i> so good, you won&rsquo;t take
it amiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate
simplicity with which Susan&rsquo;s little brothers undertook her
defence, and they were, from this slight circumstance, disposed
to think yet more favourably of a family which seemed so well
united.&nbsp; They took Susan along with them through the
village.&nbsp; Many neighbours came to their doors, and far from
envying, they all secretly wished Susan well as she passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy we shall find what we want here,&rdquo; said
Miss Somers, stopping before a shop, where unfolded sheets of
pins and glass buttons glistened in the window, and where rolls
of many coloured ribbons appeared ranged in tempting order.&nbsp;
She went in, and was rejoiced to see the shelves at the back of
the counter well-furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs, and gay,
neat printed linens and calicoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Susan, choose yourself a gown,&rdquo; said Miss
Somers; &ldquo;you set an example of industry and good conduct,
of which we wish to take public notice, for the benefit of
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shopkeeper, who was father to Susan&rsquo;s friend Rose,
looked much satisfied by this speech, and as if a compliment had
been paid to himself, bowed low to Miss Somers, and then with
alertness, which a London linen-draper might have admired,
produced piece after piece of his best goods to his young
customer&mdash;unrolled, unfolded, held the bright stuffs and
calendered calicoes in various lights.&nbsp; Now stretched his
arm to the highest shelves, and brought down in a trice what
seemed to be beyond the reach of any but a giant&rsquo;s arm; now
dived into some hidden recess beneath the counter, and brought to
light fresh beauties and fresh temptations.</p>
<p>Susan looked on with more indifference than most of the
spectators.&nbsp; She was thinking much of her lamb, and more of
her father.</p>
<p>Miss Somers had put a bright guinea into her hand, and had bid
her pay for her own gown; but Susan, as she looked at the guinea,
thought it was a great deal of money to lay out upon herself, and
she wished, but did know like to ask, that she might keep it for
a better purpose.</p>
<p>Some people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings, and
incapable of reading the countenances of those on whom they
bestow their bounty.&nbsp; Miss Somers and her sister were not of
this roughly charitable class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not like any of these things,&rdquo; whispered
Miss Somers to her sister.&nbsp; Her sister observed, that Susan
looked as if her thoughts were far distant from gowns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t fancy any of these,&rdquo; said the
civil shopkeeper to Susan, &ldquo;we shall have a new assortment
of calicoes for the spring season, soon from town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; interrupted Susan, with a smile and a blush;
&ldquo;these are all pretty, and too good for me,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But</i> what, Susan?&rdquo; said Miss Somers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell us what is passing in your little mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Susan hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well then, we will not press you,
you are scarcely acquainted with us yet; when you are, you will
not be afraid, I hope, to speak your mind.&nbsp; Put this shining
yellow counter,&rdquo; continued she, pointing to the guinea,
&ldquo;in your pocket, and make what use of it you please.&nbsp;
From what we know, and from what we have heard of you, we are
persuaded that you will make a good use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, madam,&rdquo; said the master of the shop,
with a shrewd, good natured look, &ldquo;I could give a pretty
good guess myself what will become of that guinea; but I say
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is right,&rdquo; said Miss Somers; &ldquo;we
leave Susan entirely at liberty; and now we will not detain her
any longer.&nbsp; Good night, Susan, we shall soon come again to
your neat cottage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Susan curtsied, with an
expressive look of gratitude, and with a modest frankness in her
countenance, which seemed to say, &ldquo;I would tell you, and
welcome, what I want to do with the guinea; but I am not used to
speak before so many people.&nbsp; When you come to our cottage
again you shall know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Susan had departed, Miss Somers turned to the obliging
shopkeeper, who was folding up all the things he had
opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have had a great deal of trouble with
us, sir,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and since Susan will not choose
a gown for herself, I must.&rdquo;&nbsp; She selected the
prettiest; and whilst the man was rolling it in paper, she asked
him several questions about Susan and her family, which he was
delighted to answer, because he had now all opportunity of saying
as much as he wished in her praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No later back, ma&rsquo;am, than last May
morning,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as my daughter Rose was telling
us, Susan did a turn, in her quiet way, by her mother, that would
not displease you if you were to hear it.&nbsp; She was to have
been Queen of the May, which in our little village, amongst the
younger tribe, is a thing that is thought of a good deal; but
Susan&rsquo;s mother was ill, and Susan, after sitting up with
her all night, would not leave her in the morning, even when they
brought the crown to her.&nbsp; She put the crown upon my
daughter Rose&rsquo;s head with her own hands; and, to be sure,
Rose loves her as well as if she was her own sister.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t speak from partiality; for I am no relation whatever
to the Prices&mdash;only a well-wisher, as everyone, I believe,
who knows them is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll send the parcel up to the
Abbey, shall I, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said Miss Somers, &ldquo;and, as
soon as you receive your new things from town, let us know.&nbsp;
You will, I hope, find us good customers and well-wishers,&rdquo;
added she, with a smile; &ldquo;for those who wish well to their
neighbours surely deserve to have well-wishers
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few words may encourage the benevolent passions, and may
dispose people to live in peace and happiness; a few words may
set them at variance, and may lead to misery and lawsuits.&nbsp;
Attorney Case and Miss Somers were both equally convinced of
this, and their practice was uniformly consistent with their
principles.</p>
<p>But now to return to Susan.&nbsp; She put the bright guinea
carefully into the glove with the twelve shillings, which she had
received from her companions on May day.&nbsp; Besides this
treasure, she calculated that the amount of the bills for bread
could not be less than eight or nine and thirty shillings; and as
her father was now sure of a week&rsquo;s reprieve, she had great
hopes that, by some means or other, it would be possible to make
up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If that could but be done,&rdquo; said she to herself,
&ldquo;how happy would my mother be.&nbsp; She would be quite
stout again, for she certainly is a great deal better, since I
told her that father would stay a week longer.&nbsp; Ah! but she
would not have blessed Attorney Case, though, if she had known
about my poor Daisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan took the path that led to the meadow by the waterside,
resolved to go by herself, and take leave of her innocent
favourite.&nbsp; But she did not pass by unperceived.&nbsp; Her
little brothers were watching for her return, and, as soon as
they saw her, they ran after her, and overtook her as she reached
the meadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did that good lady want with you?&rdquo; cried
William; but, looking up in his sister&rsquo;s face, he saw tears
in her eyes, and he was silent, and walked on quietly.&nbsp;
Susan saw her lamb by the water-side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are those
two men?&rdquo; said William.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are they going to
do with <i>Daisy</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; The two men were Attorney Case
and the butcher.&nbsp; The butcher was feeling whether the lamb
was fat.</p>
<p>Susan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow; her little
brothers ran up to the butcher, and demanded whether he was going
to <i>do any harm</i> to the lamb.&nbsp; The butcher did not
answer, but the attorney replied, &ldquo;It is not your
sister&rsquo;s lamb any longer; it&rsquo;s mine&mdash;mine to all
intents and purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours!&rdquo; cried the children, with terror;
&ldquo;and will you kill it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the butcher&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little boys now burst into piercing lamentations.&nbsp;
They pushed away the butcher&rsquo;s hand; they threw their arms
round the neck of the lamb; they kissed its forehead&mdash;it
bleated.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will not bleat to-morrow!&rdquo; said
William, and he wept bitterly.&nbsp; The butcher looked aside,
and hastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue
apron.</p>
<p>The attorney stood unmoved; he pulled up the head of the lamb,
which had just stooped to crop a mouthful of clover.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have no time to waste,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;butcher,
you&rsquo;ll account with me.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s fat&mdash;the
sooner the better.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no more to say.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he walked off, deaf to the prayers of the poor children.</p>
<p>As soon as the attorney was out of sight, Susan rose from the
bank where she was seated, came up to her lamb, and stooped to
gather some of the fresh dewy trefoil, to let it eat out of her
hand for the last time.&nbsp; Poor Daisy licked her well known
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let us go,&rdquo; said Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait as long as you please,&rdquo; said the
butcher.&nbsp; Susan thanked him, but walked away quickly,
without looking again at her lamb.&nbsp; Her little brothers
begged the man to stay a few minutes, for they had gathered a
handful of blue speedwell and yellow crowsfoot, and they were
decking the poor animal.&nbsp; As it followed the boys through
the village, the children collected as they passed, and the
butcher&rsquo;s own son was amongst the number.&nbsp;
Susan&rsquo;s steadiness about the bad shilling was full in this
boy&rsquo;s memory; it had saved him a beating.&nbsp; He went
directly to his father to beg the life of Susan&rsquo;s lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking about it, boy, myself,&rdquo; said the
butcher; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a sin to kill a <i>pet lamb</i>,
I&rsquo;m thinking&mdash;any way, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m not
used to, and don&rsquo;t fancy doing, and I&rsquo;ll go and say
as much to Attorney Case; but he&rsquo;s a hard man;
there&rsquo;s but one way to deal with him, and that&rsquo;s the
way I must take, though so be I shall be the loser thereby; but
we&rsquo;ll say nothing to the boys, for fear it might be the
thing would not take; and then it would be worse again to poor
Susan, who is a good girl, and always was, as well as she may,
being of a good breed, and well reared from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, lads, don&rsquo;t keep a crowd and a scandal
about my door,&rdquo; continued he, aloud, to the children;
&ldquo;turn the lamb in here, John, in the paddock, for to-night,
and go your ways home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd dispersed, but murmured, and the butcher went to the
attorney.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seeing that all you want is a good, fat,
tender lamb, for a present for Sir Arthur, as you told me,&rdquo;
said the butcher, &ldquo;I could let you have what&rsquo;s as
good or better for your purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better&mdash;if it&rsquo;s better, I&rsquo;m ready to
hear reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butcher had choice, tender lamb, he said, fit to eat the
next day; and as Mr. Case was impatient to make his offering to
Sir Arthur, he accepted the butcher&rsquo;s proposal, though with
such seeming reluctance, that he actually squeezed out of him,
before he would complete the bargain, a bribe of a fine
sweetbread.</p>
<p>In the meantime Susan&rsquo;s brothers ran home to tell her
that her lamb was put into the paddock for the night; this was
all they knew, and even this was some comfort to her.&nbsp; Rose,
her good friend, was with her, and she had before her the
pleasure of telling her father of his week&rsquo;s
reprieve.&nbsp; Her mother was better, and even said she was
determined to sit up to supper in her wicker armchair.</p>
<p>Susan was getting this ready for supper, when little William,
who was standing at the house door, watching in the dusk for his
father&rsquo;s return, suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;Susan! if here
is not our old man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old harper, &ldquo;I have found my
way to you.&nbsp; The neighbours were kind enough to show me
whereabouts you lived; for, though I didn&rsquo;t know your name,
they guessed who I meant by what I said of you all.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Susan came to the door, and the old man was delighted to hear her
speak again.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it would not be too bold,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a stranger in this part of the country,
and come from afar off.&nbsp; My boy has got a bed for himself
here in the village; but I have no place.&nbsp; Could you be so
charitable as to give an old blind man a night&rsquo;s
lodging?&rdquo;&nbsp; Susan said she would step in and ask her
mother; and she soon returned with an answer, that he was
heartily welcome, if he could sleep upon the children&rsquo;s
bed, which was but small.</p>
<p>The old man thankfully entered the hospitable cottage.&nbsp;
He struck his head against the low roof, as he stepped over the
doorsill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many roofs that are twice as high are not
half so good,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; Of this he had just had
experience at the house of the Attorney Case, while he had asked,
but had been roughly refused all assistance by Miss Barbara, who
was, according to her usual custom, standing staring at the hall
door.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s harp was set down in Farmer Price&rsquo;s
kitchen, and he promised to play a tune for the boys before they
went to bed; their mother giving them leave to sit up to supper
with their father.&nbsp; He came home with a sorrowful
countenance; but how soon did it brighten, when Susan, with a
smile, said to him, &ldquo;Father, we&rsquo;ve good news for you!
good news for us all!&mdash;You have a whole week longer to stay
with us; and perhaps,&rdquo; continued she, putting her little
purse into his hands,&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps with what&rsquo;s
here, and the bread bills, and what may somehow be got together
before a week&rsquo;s at an end, we may make up the nine guineas
for the substitute, as they call him.&nbsp; Who knows, dearest
mother, but we may keep him with us for ever!&rdquo;&nbsp; As she
spoke, she threw her arms round her father, who pressed her to
his bosom without speaking, for his heart was full.&nbsp; He was
some little time before he could perfectly believe that what he
heard was true; but the revived smiles of his wife, the noisy joy
of his little boys, and the satisfaction that shone in
Susan&rsquo;s countenance, convinced him that he was not in a
dream.</p>
<p>As they sat down to supper, the old harper was made welcome to
his share of the cheerful though frugal meal.</p>
<p>Susan&rsquo;s father, as soon as supper was finished, even
before he would let the harper play a tune for his boys, opened
the little purse, which Susan had given him.&nbsp; He was
surprised at the sight of the twelve shillings, and still more,
when he came to the bottom of the purse, to see the bright golden
guinea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come by all this money, Susan?&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly and handsomely, that I&rsquo;m sure of
beforehand,&rdquo; said her proud mother; &ldquo;but how I
can&rsquo;t make out, except by the baking.&nbsp; Hey, Susan is
this your first baking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;I have her
first baking snug here, besides, in my pocket.&nbsp; I kept it
for a surprise, to do your mother&rsquo;s heart good,
Susan.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s twenty-nine shillings, and the Abbey
bill, which is not paid yet, comes to ten more.&nbsp; What think
you of this, wife?&nbsp; Have we not a right to be proud of our
Susan?&nbsp; Why,&rdquo; continued he, turning to the harper,
&ldquo;I ask your pardon for speaking out so free before
strangers in praise of my own, which I know is not mannerly; but
the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken, as I think, at all
times; therefore, here&rsquo;s your good health, Susan; why,
by-and-by she&rsquo;ll be worth her weight in gold&mdash;in
silver at least.&nbsp; But tell us, child, how came you by all
this riches? and how comes it that I don&rsquo;t go
to-morrow?&nbsp; All this happy news makes me so gay in myself,
I&rsquo;m afraid I shall hardly understand it rightly.&nbsp; But
speak on, child&mdash;first bringing us a bottle of the good mead
you made last year from your own honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan did not much like to tell the history of her
guinea-hen&mdash;of the gown and of her poor lamb.&nbsp; Part of
this would seem as if she was vaunting of her own generosity, and
part of it she did not like to recollect.&nbsp; But her mother
pressed to know the whole, and she related it as simply as she
could.&nbsp; When she came to the story of her lamb, her voice
faltered, and everybody present was touched.&nbsp; The old harper
sighed once, and cleared his throat several times.&nbsp; He then
asked for his harp, and, after tuning it for a considerable time,
he recollected&mdash;for he had often fits of absence&mdash;that
he sent for it to play the tune he had promised to the boys.</p>
<p>This harper came from a great distance, from the mountains of
Wales, to contend with several other competitors for a prize,
which had been advertised by a musical society about a year
before this time.&nbsp; There was to be a splendid ball given
upon the occasion at Shrewsbury, which was about five miles from
our village.&nbsp; The prize was ten guineas for the best
performer on the harp, and the prize was now to be decided in a
few days.</p>
<p>All this intelligence Barbara had long since gained from her
maid, who often paid visits to the town of Shrewsbury, and she
had long had her imagination inflamed with the idea of this
splendid music-meeting and ball.&nbsp; Often had she sighed to be
there, and often had she revolved in her mind schemes for
introducing herself to some <i>genteel</i> neighbours, who might
take her to the ball <i>in their carriage</i>.&nbsp; How
rejoiced, how triumphant was she, when this very evening, just
about the time when the butcher was bargaining with her father
about Susan&rsquo;s lamb, a servant from the Abbey rapped at the
door, and left a card for Mr. and Miss Barbara Case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Bab, &ldquo;<i>I</i> and
<i>papa</i> are to dine and drink tea at the Abbey
to-morrow.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; I daresay, when they see that
I&rsquo;m not a vulgar person, and all that; and if I go
cunningly to work with Miss Somers, as I shall, to be sure, I
daresay, she&rsquo;ll take me to the ball with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said the maid; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the
least one may expect from a lady who <i>demeans</i> herself to
visit Susan Price, and goes about a-shopping for her.&nbsp; The
least she can do for you is to take you in her carriage,
<i>which</i> costs nothing, but is just a common civility, to a
ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pray, Betty,&rdquo; continued Miss Barbara,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget to-morrow, the first thing you do, to
send off to Shrewsbury for my new bonnet.&nbsp; I must have it
<i>to dine in</i>, at the Abbey, or the ladies will think nothing
of me; and Betty, remember the mantua-maker too.&nbsp; I must see
and coax papa to buy me a new gown against the ball.&nbsp; I can
see, you know, something of the fashions to-morrow at the
Abbey.&nbsp; I shall <i>look the ladies well over</i>, I promise
you.&nbsp; And, Betty, I have thought of the most charming
present for Miss Somers, as papa says it&rsquo;s good never to go
empty-handed to a great house, I&rsquo;ll make Miss Somers, who
is fond, as her maid told you, of such things&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
make Miss Somers a present of that guinea-hen of Susan&rsquo;s;
it&rsquo;s of no use to me, so do you carry it up early in the
morning to the Abbey, with my compliments.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In full confidence that her present and her bonnet would
operate effectually in her favour, Miss Barbara paid her first
visit at the Abbey.&nbsp; She expected to see wonders.&nbsp; She
was dressed in all the finery which she had heard from her maid,
who had heard from the &rsquo;prentice of a Shrewsbury milliner,
was <i>the thing</i> in London; and she was much surprised and
disappointed, when she was shown into the room where the Miss
Somerses and the ladies of the Abbey were sitting, to see that
they did not, in any one part of their dress, agree with the
picture her imagination had formed of fashionable ladies.&nbsp;
She was embarrassed when she saw books and work and drawings upon
the table, and she began to think that some affront was meant to
her, because <i>the company</i> did not sit with their hands
before them.</p>
<p>When Miss Somers endeavoured to find out conversation that
would interest her, and spoke of walks and flowers and gardening,
of which she was herself fond, Miss Barbara still thought herself
undervalued, and soon contrived to expose her ignorance most
completely, by talking of things which she did not
understand.</p>
<p>Those who never attempt to appear what they are
not&mdash;those who do not in their manners pretend to anything
unsuited to their habits and situation in life, never are in
danger of being laughed at by sensible, well bred people of any
rank; but affectation is the constant and just object of
ridicule.</p>
<p>Miss Barbara Case, with her mistaken airs of gentility, aiming
to be thought a woman, and a fine lady, whilst she was, in
reality, a child and a vulgar attorney&rsquo;s daughter, rendered
herself so thoroughly ridiculous, that the good natured, yet
discerning spectators were painfully divided between their sense
of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who could feel
nothing for herself.</p>
<p>One by one the ladies dropped off.&nbsp; Miss Somers went out
of the room for a few minutes to alter her dress, as it was the
custom of the family, before dinner.&nbsp; She left a portfolio
of pretty drawings and good prints, for Miss Barbara&rsquo;s
amusement; but Miss Barbara&rsquo;s thoughts were so intent upon
the harpers&rsquo; ball, that she could not be entertained with
such <i>trifles</i>.&nbsp; How unhappy are those who spend their
time in expectation!&nbsp; They can never enjoy the present
moment.&nbsp; Whilst Barbara was contriving means of interesting
Miss Somers in her favour, she recollected, with surprise, that
not one word had yet been said of her present of the
guinea-hen.&nbsp; Mrs. Betty, in the hurry of her dressing her
young lady in the morning, had forgotten it; but it came just
whilst Miss Somers was dressing; and the housekeeper came into
her mistress&rsquo; room to announce its arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a
beautiful guinea-hen just come, with Miss Barbara Case&rsquo;s
compliments to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Somers knew, by the tone which the housekeeper delivered
this message, that there was something in the business which did
not perfectly please her.&nbsp; She made no answer, in
expectation that the housekeeper, who was a woman of a very open
temper, would explain her cause of dissatisfaction.&nbsp; In this
she was not mistaken.&nbsp; The housekeeper came close up to the
dressing table, and continued, &ldquo;I never like to speak till
I&rsquo;m sure, ma&rsquo;am, and I&rsquo;m not quite sure, to say
certain, in this case, ma&rsquo;am, but still I think it right to
tell you, which can&rsquo;t wrong anybody, what came across my
mind about this same guinea-hen, ma&rsquo;am; and you can inquire
into it, and do as you please afterwards, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Some
time ago we had fine guinea-fowls of our own, and I made bold,
not thinking, to be sure, that all our own would die away from
us, as they have done, to give a fine couple last Christmas to
Susan Price, and very fond and pleased she was at the time, and
I&rsquo;m sure would never have parted with the hen with her
good-will; but if my eyes don&rsquo;t strangely mistake, this
hen, that comes from Miss Barbara, is the selfsame identical
guinea-hen that I gave to Susan.&nbsp; And how Miss Bab came by
it is the thing that puzzles me.&nbsp; If my boy Philip was at
home, maybe, as he&rsquo;s often at Mrs. Price&rsquo;s (which I
don&rsquo;t disapprove), he might know the history of the
guinea-hen.&nbsp; I expect him home this night, and if you have
no objection, I will sift the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shortest way, I think,&rdquo; said Henrietta,
&ldquo;would be to ask Miss Case herself about it, which I will
do this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the
housekeeper, coldly; for she knew that Miss Barbara was not
famous in the village for speaking truth.</p>
<p>Dinner was now served.&nbsp; Attorney Case expected to smell
mint sauce, and, as the covers were taken from off the dishes,
looked around for lamb; but no lamb appeared.&nbsp; He had a
dexterous knack of twisting the conversation to his point.&nbsp;
Sir Arthur was speaking, when they sat down to dinner, of a new
carving knife, which he lately had had made for his sister.&nbsp;
The attorney immediately went from carving-knives to poultry;
thence to butcher&rsquo;s meat.&nbsp; Some joints, he observed,
were much more difficult to carve than others.&nbsp; He never saw
a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him, who was the
curate of the parish.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said the
vulgar attorney, &ldquo;I must make bold to differ with you in
one point, and I&rsquo;ll appeal to Sir Arthur.&nbsp; Sir Arthur,
pray may I ask, when you carve a forequarter of lamb, do you,
when you raise the shoulder, throw in salt, or not?&rdquo;&nbsp;
This well prepared question was not lost upon Sir Arthur.&nbsp;
The attorney was thanked for his intended present; but mortified
and surprised to hear Sir Arthur say that it was a constant rule
of his never to accept of any presents from his neighbours.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If we were to accept a lamb from a rich neighbour on my
estate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am afraid we should mortify many
of our poor tenants, who can have little to offer, though,
perhaps, they may bear us thorough good-will
notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the ladies left the dining-room, as they were walking up
and down the large hall, Miss Barbara had a fair opportunity of
imitating her keen father&rsquo;s method of conversing.&nbsp; One
of the ladies observed, that this hall would be a charming place
for music.&nbsp; Bab brought in harps and harpers, and the
harpers&rsquo; ball, in a breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know so much
about it,&mdash;about the ball I mean,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;because a lady in Shrewsbury, a friend of papa&rsquo;s,
offered to take me with her; but papa did not like to give her
the trouble of sending so far for me, though she has a coach of
her own.&rdquo;&nbsp; Barbara fixed her eyes upon Miss Somers as
she spoke; but she could not read her countenance as distinctly
as she wished, because Miss Somers was at this moment letting
down the veil of her hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we walk out before tea?&rdquo; said Miss Somers
to her companions; &ldquo;I have a pretty guinea-hen to show
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Barbara, secretly drawing propitious omens from
the guinea-hen, followed with a confidential step.&nbsp; The
pheasantry was well filled with pheasants, peacocks, etc., and
Susan&rsquo;s pretty little guinea-hen appeared well, even in
this high company.&nbsp; It was much admired.&nbsp; Barbara was
in glory; but her glory was of short duration.</p>
<p>Just as Miss Somers was going to inquire into the
guinea-hen&rsquo;s history, Philip came up, to ask permission to
have a bit of sycamore, to turn a nutmeg box for his
mother.&nbsp; He was an ingenious lad, and a good turner for his
age.&nbsp; Sir Arthur had put by a bit of sycamore, on purpose
for him; and Miss Somers told him where it was to be found.&nbsp;
He thanked her: but in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was
struck by the sight of the guinea-hen, and he involuntarily
exclaimed, &ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s guinea-hen, I
declare!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not Susan&rsquo;s
guinea-hen,&rdquo; said Miss Barbara, colouring furiously;
&ldquo;it is mine, and I have made a present of it to Miss
Somers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of Bab&rsquo;s voice, Philip turned&mdash;saw
her&mdash;and indignation, unrestrained by the presence of all
the amazed spectators, flashed in his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Philip?&rdquo; said Miss Somers, in
a pacifying tone; but Philip was not inclined to be
pacified.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;may I speak out?&rdquo; and, without waiting for
permission, he spoke out, and gave a full, true, and warm account
of Rose&rsquo;s embassy, and of Miss Barbara&rsquo;s cruel and
avaricious proceedings.</p>
<p>Barbara denied, prevaricated, stammered, and at last was
overcome with confusion; for which even the most indulgent
spectators could scarcely pity her.</p>
<p>Miss Somers, however, mindful of what was due to her guest,
was anxious to dispatch Philip for his piece of sycamore.&nbsp;
Bab recovered herself as soon as he was out of sight; but she
further exposed herself by exclaiming, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
wish this pitiful guinea-hen had never come into my
possession.&nbsp; I wish Susan had kept it at home, as she should
have done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she will be more careful now that she has
received so strong a lesson,&rdquo; said Miss Somers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shall we try her?&rdquo; continued she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Philip will, I daresay, take the guinea-hen back to Susan,
if we desire it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Barbara,
sullenly; &ldquo;I have nothing more to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the guinea-hen was delivered to Philip, who set off
joyfully with his prize, and was soon in sight of Farmer
Price&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; He stopped when he came to the
door.&nbsp; He recollected Rose and her generous friendship for
Susan.&nbsp; He was determined that she should have the pleasure
of restoring the guinea-hen.&nbsp; He ran into the village.&nbsp;
All the children who had given up their little purse on May day
were assembled on the play-green.&nbsp; They were delighted to
see the guinea-hen once more.&nbsp; Philip took his pipe and
tabor, and they marched in innocent triumph towards the
whitewashed cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me come with you&mdash;let me come with you,&rdquo;
said the butcher&rsquo;s boy to Philip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop one
minute! my father has something to say to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
darted into his father&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The little procession
stopped, and in a few minutes the bleating of a lamb was
heard.&nbsp; Through a back passage, which led into the paddock
behind the house, they saw the butcher leading a lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Daisy!&rdquo; exclaimed
Rose&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Daisy!&rdquo; repeated all her
companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s lamb!&nbsp; Susan&rsquo;s
lamb!&rdquo; and there was a universal shout of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said the good butcher, as
soon as he could be heard,&mdash;&ldquo;for my part, I would not
be so cruel as Attorney Case for the whole world.&nbsp; These
poor brute beasts don&rsquo;t know aforehand what&rsquo;s going
to happen to them; and as for dying, it&rsquo;s what we must all
do some time or another; but to keep wringing the hearts of the
living, that have as much sense as one&rsquo;s self, is what I
call cruel; and is not this what Attorney Case has been doing by
poor Susan and her whole family, ever since he took a spite
against them?&nbsp; But, at anyrate, here&rsquo;s Susan&rsquo;s
lamb safe and sound.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have taken it back sooner,
but I was off before day to the fair, and am but just come
back.&nbsp; Daisy, however, has been as well off in my paddock as
he would have been in the field by the waterside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The obliging shopkeeper, who showed the pretty calicoes to
Susan, was now at his door, and when he saw the lamb, and heard
that it was Susan&rsquo;s, and learned its history, he said that
he would add his mite; and he gave the children some ends of
narrow riband, with which Rose decorated her friend&rsquo;s
lamb.</p>
<p>The pipe and tabor now once more began to play, and the
procession moved on in joyful order, after giving the humane
butcher three cheers; three cheers which were better deserved
than &ldquo;loud huzzas&rdquo; usually are.</p>
<p>Susan was working in her arbour, with her little deal table
before her.&nbsp; When she heard the sound of the music, she put
down her work and listened.&nbsp; She saw the crowd of children
coming nearer and nearer.&nbsp; They had closed round Daisy, so
that she did not see it; but as they came up to the garden gate
she saw that Rose beckoned to her.&nbsp; Philip played as loud as
he could, that she might not hear, till the proper moment, the
bleating of the lamb.&nbsp; Susan opened the garden-wicket, and
at this signal the crowd divided, and the first thing that Susan
saw, in the midst of her taller friends, was little smiling Mary,
with the guinea-hen in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&nbsp; Come on!&rdquo; cried Mary, as Susan
started with joyful surprise; &ldquo;you have more to
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant the music paused, Susan heard the bleating of
a lamb, and scarcely daring to believe her senses, she pressed
eagerly forward, and beheld poor Daisy!&mdash;she burst into
tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not shed one tear when I parted with
you, my dear little Daisy!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
for my father and mother.&nbsp; I would not have parted with you
for anything else in the whole world.&nbsp; Thank you, thank you
all,&rdquo; added she, to her companions, who sympathized in her
joy, even more than they had sympathized in her sorrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, if my father was not to go away from us next week,
and if my mother was quite stout, I should be the happiest person
in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Susan pronounced these words, a voice behind the little
listening crowd cried, in a brutal tone, &ldquo;Let us pass, if
you please; you have no right to stop up the public
road!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the voice of Attorney Case, who was
returning with his daughter Barbara from his visit to the
Abbey.&nbsp; He saw the lamb, and tried to whistle as he went
on.&nbsp; Barbara also saw the guinea-hen, and turned her head
another way, that she might avoid the contemptuous, reproachful
looks of those whom she only affected to despise.&nbsp; Even her
new bonnet, in which she had expected to be so much admired, was
now only serviceable to hide her face and conceal her
mortification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad she saw the guinea-hen,&rdquo; cried Rose,
who now held it in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll not forget
May day in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I neither, I hope,&rdquo; said Susan, looking round
upon her companions with a most affectionate smile: &ldquo;I
hope, whilst I live, I shall never forget your goodness to me
last May day.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ve my pretty guinea-hen safe once
more, I should think of returning your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo; was the general cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want the money&mdash;keep it, keep it&mdash;you want
it for your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;I am not too proud to
be obliged.&nbsp; I <i>will</i> keep your money for my
father.&nbsp; Perhaps some time or other I may be able to
earn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; interrupted Philip, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let
us talk of earning; don&rsquo;t let us talk to her of money now;
she has not had time hardly to look at poor Daisy and her
guinea-hen. Come, we must go about our business, and let her have
them all to herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd moved away in consequence of Philip&rsquo;s
considerate advice: but it was observed that he was the very last
to stir from the garden-wicket himself.&nbsp; He stayed, first,
to inform Susan that it was Rose who tied the ribands on
Daisy&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Then he stayed a little longer to let
her into the history of the guinea-hen, and to tell her who it
was that brought the hen home from the Abbey.</p>
<p>Rose held the sieve, and Susan was feeding her long lost
favourite, whilst Philip leaned over the wicket, prolonging his
narration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, my pretty guinea-hen,&rdquo; said
Susan&mdash;&ldquo;my naughty guinea-hen, that flew away from me,
you shall never serve me so again.&nbsp; I must cut your nice
wings; but I won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; cried Philip; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
better, indeed you&rsquo;d better let me hold her whilst you cut
her wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this operation was successfully performed, which it
certainly could never have been if Philip had not held the hen
for Susan, he recollected that his mother had sent him with a
message to Mrs. Price.&nbsp; This message led to another quarter
of an hour&rsquo;s delay; for he had the whole history of the
guinea-hen to tell over again to Mrs. Price, and the farmer
himself luckily came in whilst it was going on, so it was but
civil to begin it afresh; and then the farmer was so rejoiced to
see his Susan so happy again with her two little favourites that
he declared he must see Daisy fed himself; and Philip found that
he was wanted to hold the jug full of milk, out of which Farmer
Price filled the pan for Daisy?&nbsp; Happy Daisy! who lapped at
his ease, whilst Susan caressed him, and thanked her fond father
and her pleased mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Philip,&rdquo; said Mrs. Price, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
hold the jug&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be late with your message to your
mother; we&rsquo;ll not detain you any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip departed, and as he went out of the garden-wicket, he
looked up, and saw Bab and her maid Betty staring out of the
window, as usual.&nbsp; On this, he immediately turned back to
try whether he had shut the gate fast, lest the guinea-hen might
stray out, and fall again into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>Miss Barbara, in the course of this day, felt considerable
mortification, but no contrition.&nbsp; She was vexed that her
meanness was discovered, but she felt no desire to cure herself
of any of her faults.&nbsp; The ball was still uppermost in her
vain, selfish soul. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she to her
<i>confidante</i>, Betty, &ldquo;you hear how things have turned
out; but if Miss Somers won&rsquo;t think of asking me to go out
with her, I&rsquo;ve a notion I know who will.&nbsp; As papa
says, it&rsquo;s a good thing to have two strings to one&rsquo;s
bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, some officers, who were quartered at Shrewsbury, had
become acquainted with Mr. Case.&nbsp; They had gotten into some
quarrel with a tradesman of the town, and Attorney Case had
promised to bring them through the affair, as the man threatened
to take the law of them.&nbsp; Upon the faith of this promise,
and with the vain hope that, by civility, they might dispose him
to bring in a <i>reasonable</i> bill of costs, these officers
sometimes invited Mr. Case to the mess; and one of them, who had
lately been married, prevailed upon his bride <i>sometimes</i> to
take a little notice of Miss Barbara.&nbsp; It was with this lady
that Miss Barbara now hoped to go to the harpers&rsquo; ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officers and Mrs. Strathspey, or, more properly,
Mrs. Strathspey and the officers, are to breakfast here,
to-morrow, do you know,&rdquo; said Bab to Betty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One of them dined at the Abbey, to-day, and told papa that
they&rsquo;d all come.&nbsp; They are going out on a party,
somewhere into the country, and breakfast here on their
way.&nbsp; Pray, Betty, don&rsquo;t forget that Mrs. Strathspey
can&rsquo;t breakfast without honey.&nbsp; I heard her say so
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, indeed,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid Mrs. Strathspey will be likely to go without her breakfast
here; for not a spoonful of honey have we, let her long for it
ever so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, surely,&rdquo; said Bab, &ldquo;we can contrive to
get some honey in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s none to be bought, as I know of,&rdquo;
said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is there none to be begged or borrowed?&rdquo; said
Bab, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you forget Susan&rsquo;s
beehive?&nbsp; Step over to her in the morning with <i>my
compliments</i>, and see what you can do.&nbsp; Tell her
it&rsquo;s for Mrs. Strathspey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Betty went with Miss Barbara&rsquo;s
compliments to Susan, to beg some honey for Mrs. Strathspey, who
could not breakfast without it.&nbsp; Susan did not like to part
with her honey, because her mother loved it, and she therefore
gave Betty but a small quantity.&nbsp; When Barbara saw how
little Susan sent, she called her <i>a miser</i>, and she said
she <i>must</i> have some more for Mrs. Strathspey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go myself and speak to her.&nbsp; Come with me,
Betty,&rdquo; said the young lady, who found it at present
convenient to forget her having declared, the day that she sucked
up the broth, that she never would honour Susan with another
visit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; said she, accosting the poor
girl, whom she had done everything in her power to injure,
&ldquo;I must beg a little more honey from you for Mrs.
Strathspey&rsquo;s breakfast.&nbsp; You know, on a particular
occasion such as this, neighbours must help one
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure they should,&rdquo; added Betty.</p>
<p>Susan, though she was generous, was not weak; she was willing
to give to those she loved, but not disposed to let anything be
taken from her, or coaxed out of her, by those she had reason to
despise.&nbsp; She civilly answered, that she was sorry she had
no more honey to spare.</p>
<p>Barbara grew angry, and lost all command of herself, when she
saw that Susan, without regarding her reproaches, went on looking
through the glass pane in the beehive.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you what, Susan Price,&rdquo; said she, in a high tone,
&ldquo;the honey I <i>will</i> have, so you may as well give it
to me by fair means.&nbsp; Yes or no!&nbsp; Speak!&nbsp; Will you
give it me or not?&nbsp; Will you give me that piece of the
honey-comb that lies there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bit of honey-comb is for my mother&rsquo;s
breakfast,&rdquo; said Susan; &ldquo;I cannot give it
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Bab, &ldquo;then see if I
don&rsquo;t take it!&rdquo;&nbsp; She stretched across Susan for
the honey-comb, which was lying by some rosemary leaves that
Susan had freshly gathered for her mother&rsquo;s tea.&nbsp; Bab
grasped, but at her first effort she only reached the
rosemary.&nbsp; She made a second dart at the honey-comb, and, in
her struggle to obtain it, she overset the beehive.&nbsp; The
bees swarmed about her.&nbsp; Her maid Betty screamed and ran
away.&nbsp; Susan, who was sheltered by a laburnum tree, called
to Barbara, upon whom the black clusters of bees were now
settling, and begged her to stand still, and not to beat them
away.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you stand quietly you won&rsquo;t be stung,
perhaps.&rdquo;&nbsp; But instead of standing quietly, Bab
buffeted and stamped and roared, and the bees stung her
terribly.&nbsp; Her arms and her face swelled in a frightful
manner.&nbsp; She was helped home by poor Susan and treacherous
Mrs. Betty, who, now the mischief was done, thought only of
exculpating herself to her master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Miss Barbara,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;this was
quite wrong of you to go and get yourself into such a
scrape.&nbsp; I shall be turned away for it, you&rsquo;ll
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether you are turned away or
not,&rdquo; said Barbara; &ldquo;I never felt such pain in my
life.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you do something for me?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mind the pain either so much as being such a
fright.&nbsp; Pray, how am I to be fit to be seen at breakfast by
Mrs. Strathspey; and I suppose I can&rsquo;t go to the ball
either to-morrow, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that you can&rsquo;t expect to do, indeed,&rdquo;
said Betty, the comforter.&nbsp; &ldquo;You need not think of
balls; for those lumps and swellings won&rsquo;t go off your face
this week.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not what pains me; but I&rsquo;m
thinking of what your papa will say to me when he sees you,
miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst this amiable mistress and maid were in their adversity
reviling one another, Susan, when she saw that she could be of no
further use, was preparing to depart, but at the house-door, she
was met by Mr. Case.&nbsp; Mr. Case had revolved things in his
mind; for his second visit at the Abbey pleased him as little as
his first, owing to a few words which Sir Arthur and Miss Somers
dropped in speaking of Susan and Farmer Price.&nbsp; Mr. Case
began to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with
this family.&nbsp; The refusal of his present dwelt upon the
attorney&rsquo;s mind; and he was aware that, if the history of
Susan&rsquo;s lamb ever reached the Abbey, he was undone.&nbsp;
He now thought that the most prudent course he could possibly
follow would be to <i>hush up</i> matters with the <i>Prices</i>
with all convenient speed.&nbsp; Consequently, when he met Susan
at his door, he forced a gracious smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is your
mother, Susan?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there anything in
our house can be of service to her?&rdquo;&nbsp; On hearing his
daughter he cried out, &ldquo;Barbara, Barbara&mdash;Bab! come
downstairs, child, and speak to Susan Price.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as
no Barbara answered, her father stalked upstairs directly, opened
the door, and stood amazed at the spectacle of her swelled
visage.</p>
<p>Betty instantly began to tell the story of Barbara&rsquo;s
mishap her own way.&nbsp; Bab contradicted her as fast as she
spoke.&nbsp; The attorney turned the maid away on the spot; and
partly with real anger, and partly with feigned affectation of
anger, he demanded from his daughter how she dared to treat Susan
Price so ill, &ldquo;when,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;she was so
neighbourly and obliging as to give you some of her honey?&nbsp;
Couldn&rsquo;t you be content, without seizing upon the
honey-comb by force?&nbsp; This is scandalous behaviour, and
what, I assure you, I can&rsquo;t countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan now interceded for Barbara; and the attorney, softening
his voice, said that &ldquo;Susan was a great deal too good to
her; as you are, indeed,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;to
everybody.&nbsp; I forgive her for your sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; Susan
curtsied, in great surprise; but her lamb could not be forgotten,
and she left the attorney&rsquo;s house as soon as she could, to
make her mother&rsquo;s rosemary tea breakfast.</p>
<p>Mr. Case saw that Susan was not so simple as to be taken in by
a few fair words.&nbsp; His next attempt was to conciliate Farmer
Price.&nbsp; The farmer was a blunt, honest man, and his
countenance remained inflexibly contemptuous, when the attorney
addressed him in his softest tone.</p>
<p>So stood matters the day of the long expected harpers&rsquo;
ball.&nbsp; Miss Barbara Case, stung by Susan&rsquo;s bees, could
not, after all her man&oelig;uvres, go with Mrs. Strathspey to
the ball.&nbsp; The ballroom was filled early in the
evening.&nbsp; There was a numerous assembly.&nbsp; The harpers,
who contended for the prize, were placed under the music-gallery
at the lower end of the room.&nbsp; Amongst them was our old
blind friend, who, as he was not so well clad as his competitors,
seemed to be disdained by many of the spectators.&nbsp; Six
ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges of the
performance.&nbsp; They were seated in a semicircle, opposite to
the harpers.&nbsp; The Miss Somerses, who were fond of music,
were amongst the ladies in the semicircle; and the prize was
lodged in the hands of Sir Arthur.&nbsp; There was now
silence.&nbsp; The first harp sounded, and as each musician tried
his skill, the audience seemed to think that each deserved the
prize.&nbsp; The old blind man was the last.&nbsp; He tuned his
instrument; and such a simple, pathetic strain was heard as
touched every heart.&nbsp; All were fixed in delighted attention;
and when the music ceased, the silence for some moments
continued.</p>
<p>The silence was followed by a universal buzz of
applause.&nbsp; The judges were unanimous in their opinions, and
it was declared that the old blind harper, who played the last,
deserved the prize.</p>
<p>The simple, pathetic air which won the suffrages of the whole
assembly, was his own composition.&nbsp; He was pressed to give
the words belonging to the music; and at last he modestly offered
to repeat them, as he could not see to write.&nbsp; Miss
Somers&rsquo; ready pencil was instantly produced; and the old
harper dictated the words of his ballad, which he
called&mdash;&ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Lamentation for her
Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Somers looked at her brother from time to time, as she
wrote; and Sir Arthur, as soon as the old man had finished, took
him aside, and asked him some questions, which brought the whole
history of Susan&rsquo;s lamb and of Attorney Case&rsquo;s
cruelty to light.</p>
<p>The attorney himself was present when the harper began to
dictate his ballad.&nbsp; His colour, as Sir Arthur steadily
looked at him, varied continually; till at length, when he heard
the words &ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Lamentation for her Lamb,&rdquo;
he suddenly shrunk back, skulked through the crowd, and
disappeared.&nbsp; We shall not follow him; we had rather follow
our old friend, the victorious harper.</p>
<p>No sooner had he received the ten guineas, his well merited
prize, than he retired to a small room belonging to the people of
the house, asked for pen, ink and paper, and dictated, in a low
voice, to his boy, who was a tolerably good scribe, a letter,
which he ordered him to put directly into the Shrewsbury
post-office.&nbsp; The boy ran with the letter to the
post-office.&nbsp; He was but just in time, for the
postman&rsquo;s horn was sounding.</p>
<p>The next morning, when Farmer Price, his wife, and Susan, were
sitting together, reflecting that his week&rsquo;s leave of
absence was nearly at an end, and that the money was not yet made
up for John Simpson, the substitute, a knock was heard at the
door, and the person who usually delivered the letters in the
village put a letter into Susan&rsquo;s hand, saying, &ldquo;A
penny, if you please&mdash;here&rsquo;s a letter for your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me!&rdquo; said Farmer Price; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
the penny then, but who can it be from, I wonder?&nbsp; Who can
think of writing to me, in this world?&rdquo;&nbsp; He tore open
the letter; but the hard name at the bottom of the page puzzled
him&mdash;&ldquo;your obliged friend, Llewellyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said he, opening a paper
that was inclosed in the letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a song,
seemingly; it must be somebody that has a mind to make an April
fool of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is not April, it is May, father,&rdquo; said
Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us read the letter, and we shall come to the
truth all in good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Price sat down in his own chair, for he could not read
entirely to his satisfaction in any other, and read as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Worthy
Friend</span>,&mdash;I am sure you will be glad to hear that I
have had good success this night.&nbsp; I have won the ten guinea
prize, and for that I am in a great measure indebted to your
sweet daughter Susan; as you will see by a little ballad I
inclose for her.&nbsp; Your hospitality to me has afforded to me
an opportunity of learning some of your family history.&nbsp; You
do not, I hope, forget that I was present when you were counting
the treasure in Susan&rsquo;s little purse, and that I heard for
what purpose it was all destined.&nbsp; You have not, I know, yet
made up the full sum for your substitute, John Simpson; therefore
do me the favour to use the five guinea bank note which you will
find within the ballad.&nbsp; You shall not find me as hard a
creditor as Attorney Case.&nbsp; Pay me the money at your own
convenience.&nbsp; If it is never convenient to you to pay it, I
shall never ask it.&nbsp; I shall go my rounds again through this
country, I believe, about this time next year, and will call to
see how you do, and to play the new tune for Susan and the dear
little boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should just add, to set your heart at rest about the
money, that it does not distress me at all to lend it to
you.&nbsp; I am not quite so poor as I appear to be.&nbsp; But it
is my humour to go about as I do.&nbsp; I see more of the world
under my tattered garb than, perhaps, I should ever see in a
better dress.&nbsp; There are many of my profession who are of
the same mind as myself in this respect; and we are glad, when it
lies in our way, to do any kindness to such a worthy family as
yours.&mdash;So, fare ye well.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your obliged Friend,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Llewellyn</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Susan now, by her father&rsquo;s desire, opened the
ballad.&nbsp; He picked up the five guinea bank note, whilst she
read, with surprise, &ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Lamentation for her
Lamb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her mother leaned over her shoulder to read
the words; but they were interrupted, before they had finished
the first stanza, by another knock at the door.&nbsp; It was not
the postman with another letter.&nbsp; It was Sir Arthur and his
sisters.</p>
<p>They came with an intention, which they were much disappointed
to find that the old harper had rendered vain&mdash;they came to
lend the farmer and his good family the money to pay for his
substitute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, since we are here,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur,
&ldquo;let me do my own business, which I had like to have
forgotten.&nbsp; Mr. Price, will you come out with me, and let me
show you a piece of your land, through which I want to make a
road.&nbsp; Look there,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, pointing to the
spot, &ldquo;I am laying out a ride round my estate, and that bit
of land of yours stops me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said Price, &ldquo;the land&rsquo;s
mine, to be sure, for that matter; but I hope you don&rsquo;t
look upon me to be that sort of person that would be stiff about
a trifle or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, &ldquo;I had heard
you were a litigious, pig-headed fellow; but you do not seem to
deserve this character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope not, sir,&rdquo; said the farmer; &ldquo;but about
the matter of the land, I don&rsquo;t want to take any advantage
of your wishing for it.&nbsp; You are welcome to it; and I leave
it to you to find me out another bit of land convenient to me
that will be worth neither more nor less; or else to make up the
value to me some way or other.&nbsp; I need say no more about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear something,&rdquo; continued Sir Arthur, after a
short silence&mdash;&ldquo;I hear something, Mr. Price, of a
<i>flaw</i> in your lease.&nbsp; I would not speak to you about
it whilst we were bargaining about your land, lest I should
over-awe you; but, tell me, what is this flaw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth, and the truth is the fittest thing to be
spoken at all times,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know myself what a flaw, as they call it, meant,
till I heard of the word from Attorney Case; and, I take it, <i>a
flaw</i> is neither more nor less than a mistake, as one should
say.&nbsp; Now, by reason a man does not make a mistake on
purpose, it seems to me to be the fair thing, that if a man finds
out his mistake, he might set it right; but Attorney Case says
this is not law; and I&rsquo;ve no more to say.&nbsp; The man who
drew up my lease made a mistake; and if I must suffer for it, I
must,&rdquo; said the farmer.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, I can show
you, Sir Arthur, just for my own satisfaction and yours, a few
lines of a memorandum on a slip of paper, which was given me by
your relation, the gentleman who lived here before, and let me my
farm.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see, by that bit of paper, what was
meant; but the attorney says, the paper&rsquo;s not worth a
button in a court of justice, and I don&rsquo;t understand these
things.&nbsp; All I understand is the common honesty of the
matter.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no more to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This attorney, whom you speak of so often,&rdquo; said
Sir Arthur, &ldquo;you seem to have some quarrel with.&nbsp; Now,
would you tell me frankly what is the matter
between&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter between us, then,&rdquo; said Price,
&ldquo;is a little bit of ground, not worth much, that is there
open to the lane at the end of Mr. Case&rsquo;s garden, sir, and
he wanted to take it in.&nbsp; Now I told him my mind, that it
belonged to the parish, and that I never would willingly give my
consent to his cribbing it in that way.&nbsp; Sir, I was the more
loath to see it shut into his garden, which, moreover, is large
enough of all conscience without it, because you must know, Sir
Arthur, the children in our village are fond of making a little
play-green of it; and they have a custom of meeting on May day at
a hawthorn that stands in the middle of it, and altogether I was
very loath to see &rsquo;em turned out of it by those who have no
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go and see this nook,&rdquo; said Sir
Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not far off, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir, just hard by here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they got to the ground, Mr. Case, who saw them walking
together, was in a hurry to join them, that he might put a stop
to any explanations.&nbsp; Explanations were things of which he
had a great dread; but, fortunately, he was upon this occasion a
little too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the nook in dispute?&rdquo; said Sir
Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; this is the whole thing,&rdquo; said Price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Sir Arthur,&rdquo; interposed the politic
attorney, with an assumed air of generosity, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
let us talk any more about it.&nbsp; Let it belong to whom it
will, I give it up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So great a lawyer, Mr. Case, as you are,&rdquo; replied
Sir Arthur, &ldquo;must know, that a man cannot give up that to
which he has no legal title; and in this case it is impossible
that, with the best intentions to oblige me in the world, you can
give up this bit of land to me, because it is mine already, as I
can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining land,
which I have fortunately safe amongst my papers.&nbsp; This piece
of ground belonged to the farm on the opposite side of the road,
and it was cut off when the lane was made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very possibly.&nbsp; I daresay you are quite correct;
you must know best,&rdquo; said the attorney, trembling for the
agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, &ldquo;Mr. Price, you
will observe that I now promise this little green to the children
for a play-ground; and I hope they may gather hawthorn many a May
day at this their favourite bush.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Price bowed
low, which he seldom did, even when he received a favour
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, Mr. Case,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur,
turning to the attorney, who did not know which way to look,
&ldquo;you sent me a lease to look over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-ye-yes,&rdquo; stammered Mr. Case.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought it my duty to do so; not out of any malice or ill-will to
this good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done him no injury,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur,
coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am ready to make him a new lease, whenever
he pleases, of his farm, and I shall be guided by a memorandum of
the original bargain, which he has in his possession.&nbsp; I
hope I never shall take an unfair advantage of anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid, sir,&rdquo; said the attorney,
sanctifying his face, &ldquo;that I should suggest the taking an
<i>unfair</i> advantage of any man, rich or poor; but to break a
bad lease is not taking an unfair advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really think so?&rdquo; said Sir Arthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I do, and I hope I have not hazarded your
good opinion by speaking my mind concerning the flaw so
plainly.&nbsp; I always understood that there could be nothing
ungentlemanlike, in the way of business, in taking advantage of a
flaw in a lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, &ldquo;you have pronounced
judgment <i>undesignedly</i> in your own case.&nbsp; You intended
to send me this poor man&rsquo;s lease; but your son, by some
mistake, brought me your own, and I have discovered a fatal error
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fatal error!&rdquo; said the alarmed attorney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, pulling the lease out
of his pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here it is.&nbsp; You will observe
that it is neither signed nor sealed by the grantor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you won&rsquo;t take advantage of me, surely, Sir
Arthur?&rdquo; said Mr. Case, forgetting his own principles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not take advantage of you, as you would have
taken of this honest man.&nbsp; In both cases I shall be guided
by memoranda which I have in my possession.&nbsp; I shall not,
Mr. Case, defraud you of one shilling of your property.&nbsp; I
am ready, at a fair valuation, to pay the exact value of your
house and land; but upon this condition&mdash;that you quit the
parish within one month!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attorney Case was thus compelled to submit to the hard
necessity of the case, for he knew that he could not legally
resist.&nbsp; Indeed he was glad to be let off so easily; and he
bowed and sneaked away, secretly comforting himself with the
hope, that when they came to the valuation of the house and land
he should be the gainer, perhaps of a few guineas.&nbsp; His
reputation he justly held very cheap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a scholar; you write a good hand; you can keep
accounts, cannot you?&rdquo; said Sir Arthur to Mr. Price, as
they walked home towards the cottage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I saw
a bill of your little daughter&rsquo;s drawing out the other day,
which was very neatly written.&nbsp; Did you teach her to
write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Price, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I
did <i>that</i>; for she mostly taught it herself, but I taught
her a little arithmetic, as far as I knew, on our winter nights,
when I had nothing better to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter shows that she has been well
taught,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur; &ldquo;and her good conduct and
good character speak strongly in favour of her
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good, very good indeed, sir, to speak in
this sort of way,&rdquo; said the delighted father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean to do more than <i>pay you with
words</i>,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are attached
to your own family, perhaps you may become attached to me, when
you come to know me, and we shall have frequent opportunities of
judging of one another.&nbsp; I want no agent to squeeze my
tenants, or do my dirty work.&nbsp; I only want a steady,
intelligent, honest man, like you, to collect my rents, and I
hope, Mr. Price, you will have no objection to the
employment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir,&rdquo; said Price, with joy and gratitude
glowing in his honest countenance, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll never
have cause to repent your goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are my sisters about here?&rdquo; said Sir
Arthur, entering the cottage, and going behind his sisters, who
were busily engaged in measuring an extremely pretty coloured
calico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for Susan, my dear brother,&rdquo; said
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know she did not keep that guinea for
herself,&rdquo; said Miss Somers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have just
prevailed upon her mother to tell me what became of it.&nbsp;
Susan gave it to her father; but she must not refuse a gown of
our choosing this time; and I am sure she will not, because her
mother, I see, likes it.&nbsp; And, Susan, I hear that instead of
becoming Queen of the May this year, you were sitting in your
sick mother&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Your mother has a little colour
in her cheeks now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Price,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite well.&nbsp; Joy, I think, has made me
quite well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Miss Somers, &ldquo;I hope you will
be able to come out on your daughter&rsquo;s birthday, which, I
hear, is the 25th of this month.&nbsp; Make haste and get quite
well before that day; for my brother intends that all the lads
and lassies of the village shall have a dance on Susan&rsquo;s
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sir Arthur, &ldquo;and I hope on that
day, Susan, you will be very happy with your little friends upon
their play-green.&nbsp; I shall tell them that it is your good
conduct which has obtained it for them; and if you have anything
to ask, any little favour for any of your companions, which we
can grant, now ask, Susan.&nbsp; These ladies look as if they
would not refuse you anything that is reasonable; and, I think,
you look as if you would not ask anything
unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Susan, after consulting her
mother&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;there is, to be sure, a favour I
should like to ask; it is for Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know who Rose is,&rdquo; said Sir
Arthur, smiling; &ldquo;but, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, you have seen her, I believe; she is a
very good girl, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Price.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
works very neatly, indeed,&rdquo; continued Susan, eagerly, to
Miss Somers; &ldquo;and she and her mother heard you were looking
out for someone to wait upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; said Miss Somers; &ldquo;your wish
is granted.&nbsp; Tell Rose to come to the Abbey, to-morrow
morning, or, rather, come with her yourself; for our housekeeper,
I know, wants to talk to you about a certain cake.&nbsp; She
wishes, Susan, that you should be the maker of the cake for the
dance; and she has good things ready looked out for it already, I
know.&nbsp; It must be large enough for everybody to have a
slice, and the housekeeper will ice it for you.&nbsp; I only hope
your cake will be as good as your bread.&nbsp; Fare ye
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How happy are those who bid farewell to a whole family, silent
with gratitude, who will bless them aloud when they are far out
of hearing!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I wish, now,&rdquo; said Farmer Price,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s almost a sin for one that has had such a
power of favours done him, to wish for anything more; but how I
<i>do</i> wish, wife, that our good friend, the harper was only
here at this time.&nbsp; It would do his old, warm heart
good.&nbsp; Well, the best of it is, we shall be able next year,
when he comes his rounds, to pay him his money with thanks, being
all the time, and for ever, as much obliged to him as if we kept
it.&nbsp; I long, so I do, to see him in this house again,
drinking, as he did, just in this spot, a glass of Susan&rsquo;s
mead, to her very good health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;and the next time he
comes, I can give him one of my guinea-hen&rsquo;s eggs, and I
shall show my lamb, Daisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, love,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;and he will
play that tune and sing that pretty ballad.&nbsp; Where is it?
for I have not finished it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose ran away with it, mother, but I&rsquo;ll step
after her, and bring it back to you this minute,&rdquo; said
Susan.</p>
<p>Susan found her friend Rose at the hawthorn, in the midst of a
crowded circle of her companions, to whom she was reading
&ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Lamentation for her Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words are something, but the tune&mdash;the
tune&mdash;I must have the tune,&rdquo; cried Philip.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask my mother to ask Sir Arthur to try and find
out which way that good old man went after the ball; and if
he&rsquo;s above ground, we&rsquo;ll have him back by
Susan&rsquo;s birthday, and he shall sit here&mdash;just exactly
here by this, our bush, and he shall play&mdash;I mean, if he
pleases&mdash;that same tune for us, and I shall learn it&mdash;I
mean, if I can&mdash;in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good news that Farmer Price was to be employed to collect
the rents, and that Attorney Case was to leave the parish in a
month, soon spread over the village.&nbsp; Many came out of their
houses to have the pleasure of hearing the joyful tidings
confirmed by Susan herself.&nbsp; The crowd on the play-green
increased every minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried the triumphant Philip, &ldquo;I tell
you it&rsquo;s all true, every word of it.&nbsp; Susan&rsquo;s
too modest to say it herself; but I tell ye all, Sir Arthur gave
us this play-green for ever, on account of her being so
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You see, at last Attorney Case, with all his cunning has not
proved a match for &ldquo;Simple Susan.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>THE
WHITE PIGEON.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little town of Somerville, in
Ireland, has, within these few years, assumed the neat and
cheerful appearance of an English village.&nbsp; Mr. Somerville,
to whom this town belongs, wished to inspire his tenantry with a
taste for order and domestic happiness, and took every means in
his power to encourage industrious, well behaved people to settle
in his neighbourhood.&nbsp; When he had finished building a row
of good slated houses in his town, he declared that he would let
them to the best tenants he could find, and proposals were
publicly sent to him from all parts of the country.</p>
<p>By the best tenants, Mr. Somerville did not, however, mean the
best bidders; and many, who had offered an extravagant price for
the houses, were surprised to find their proposals
rejected.&nbsp; Amongst these was Mr. Cox, an alehouse keeper,
who did not bear a very good character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please your honour, sir,&rdquo; said he to Mr.
Somerville, &ldquo;I expected, since I bid as fair and fairer for
it than any other, that you would have let me the house next the
apothecary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Was not it fifteen guineas I mentioned
in my proposal? and did not your honour give it against me for
thirteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My honour did just so,&rdquo; replied Mr. Somerville,
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And please your honour, but I don&rsquo;t know what it
is I or mine have done to offend you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure there
is not a gentleman in all Ireland I&rsquo;d go further to
sarve.&nbsp; Would not I go to Cork to-morrow for the least word
from your honour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you, Mr. Cox, but I have no
business at Cork at present,&rdquo; answered Mr. Somerville,
drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all I wish,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Cox, &ldquo;that
I could find out and light upon the man that has belied me to
your honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man has belied you, Mr. Cox, but your nose belies
you much, if you do not love drinking a little, and your black
eye and cut chin belie you much if you do not love quarrelling a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarrel!&nbsp; I quarrel, please your honour!&nbsp; I
defy any man, or set of men, ten mile round, to prove such a
thing, and I am ready to fight him that dares to say the like of
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d fight him here in your honour&rsquo;s
presence, if he&rsquo;d only come out this minute, and meet me
like a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Cox put himself into a boxing attitude, but observing
that Mr. Somerville looked at his threatening gesture with a
smile, and that several people, who had gathered round him as he
stood in the street, laughed at the proof he gave of his
peaceable disposition, he changed his attitude, and went on to
vindicate himself against the charge of drinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as to drink, please your honour, there&rsquo;s no
truth in it.&nbsp; Not a drop of whisky, good or bad, have I
touched these six months, except what I took with Jemmy
M&rsquo;Doole the night I had the misfortune to meet your honour
coming home from the fair of Ballynagrish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this speech Mr. Somerville made no answer, but turned away
to look at the bow window of a handsome new inn, which the
glazier was at this instant glazing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please your
honour, that new inn is not let, I hear, as yet,&rdquo; resumed
Mr. Cox; &ldquo;if your honour recollects, you promised to make
me a compliment of it last Seraphtide was twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried Mr. Somerville, &ldquo;for I
had no thoughts of building an inn at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your honour&rsquo;s pardon but if you&rsquo;d
be just pleased to recollect, it was coming through the gap in
the bog meadows, <i>forenent</i> Thady O&rsquo;Connor, you made
me the promise&mdash;I&rsquo;ll leave it to him, so I
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I will not leave it to him, I assure you,&rdquo;
cried Mr. Somerville; &ldquo;I never made any such promise.&nbsp;
I never thought of letting this inn to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your honour won&rsquo;t let me have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you have told me a dozen falsehoods.&nbsp; I do not
wish to have you for a tenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, God bless your honour; I&rsquo;ve no more to say,
but God bless your honour,&rdquo; said Mr. Cox; and he walked
away, muttering to himself, as he slouched his hat over his face,
&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll live to be revenged on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville the next morning went with his family to look
at the new inn, which he expected to see perfectly finished; but
he was met by the carpenter, who, with a rueful face, informed
him that six panes of glass in the large bow-window had been
broken during the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! perhaps Mr. Cox has broken my windows, in revenge
for my refusing to let him my house,&rdquo; said Mr. Somerville;
and many of the neighbours, who knew the malicious character of
this Mr. Cox, observed that this was like one of his
tricks.&nbsp; A boy of about twelve years old, however, stepped
forward and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Mr. Cox, I&rsquo;m
sure; for once he beat me when he was drunk; but, for all that,
no one should be accused wrongfully.&nbsp; He could not be the
person that broke these windows last night, for he was six miles
off.&nbsp; He slept at his cousin&rsquo;s last night, and he has
not returned home yet.&nbsp; So I think he knows nothing of the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville was pleased with the honest simplicity of this
boy, and observing that he looked in eagerly at the staircase,
when the house door was opened, he asked him whether he would
like to go in and see the new house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
sir,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;I should like to go up those
stairs, and to see what I should come to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with you, then!&rdquo; said Mr. Somerville; and the
boy ran up the stairs.&nbsp; He went from room to room with great
expressions of admiration and delight.&nbsp; At length, as he was
examining one of the garrets, he was startled by a fluttering
noise over his head; and looking up, he saw a white pigeon, who,
frightened at his appearance, began to fly round and round the
room, till it found its way out of the door, and flew into the
staircase.</p>
<p>The carpenter was speaking to Mr. Somerville upon the
landing-place of the stairs; but, the moment he spied the white
pigeon, he broke off in the midst of a speech about <i>the
nose</i> of the stairs, and exclaimed, &ldquo;There he is, please
your honour!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s he that has done all the damage
to our bow-window&mdash;that&rsquo;s the very same wicked white
pigeon that broke the church windows last Sunday was
se&rsquo;nnight; but he&rsquo;s down for it now; we have him
safe, and I&rsquo;ll chop his head off, as he deserves, this
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&nbsp; O stay! don&rsquo;t chop his head off: he
does not deserve it,&rdquo; cried the boy, who came running out
of the garret with the greatest eagerness&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I</i>
broke your window, sir,&rdquo; said he to Mr. Somerville.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I broke your window with this ball; but I did not know
that I had done it, till this moment, I assure you, or I should
have told you before.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t chop his head off,&rdquo;
added the boy to the carpenter, who had now the white pigeon in
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Somerville, &ldquo;the
pigeon&rsquo;s head shall not be chopped off, nor yours either,
my good boy, for breaking a window.&nbsp; I am persuaded by your
open, honest countenance, that you are speaking the truth; but
pray explain this matter to us; for you have not made it quite
clear.&nbsp; How happened it that you could break my windows
without knowing it? and how came you to find it out at
last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll come
up here, I&rsquo;ll show you all I know, and how I came to know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville followed the boy into the garret, who pointed
to a pane of glass that was broken in a small window that looked
out upon a piece of waste ground behind the house.&nbsp; Upon
this piece of waste ground the children of the village often used
to play.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were playing there at ball yesterday
evening,&rdquo; continued the boy, addressing himself to Mr.
Somerville, &ldquo;and one of the lads challenged me to hit a
mark in the wall, which I did; but he said I did not hit it, and
bade me give him up my ball as the forfeit.&nbsp; This I would
not do; and when he began to wrestle with me for it, I threw the
ball, as I thought, over the house.&nbsp; He ran to look for it
in the street, but could not find it, which I was very glad of;
but I was very sorry just now to find it myself lying upon this
heap of shavings, sir, under this broken window; for, as soon as
I saw it lying there, I knew I must have been the person that
broke the window; and through this window came the white
pigeon.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s one of his white feathers sticking in
the gap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the carpenter, &ldquo;and in the
bow-window room below there&rsquo;s plenty of his feathers to be
seen; for I&rsquo;ve just been down to look.&nbsp; It was the
pigeon broke <i>them</i> windows, sure enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he could not have got in had I not broke this
little window,&rdquo; said the boy, eagerly; &ldquo;and I am able
to earn sixpence a day, and I&rsquo;ll pay for all the mischief,
and welcome.&nbsp; The white pigeon belongs to a poor neighbour,
a friend of ours, who is very fond of him, and I would not have
him killed for twice as much money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the pigeon, my honest, generous lad,&rdquo; said
Mr. Somerville, &ldquo;and carry him back to your
neighbour.&nbsp; I forgive him all the mischief he has done me,
tell your friend, for your sake.&nbsp; As to the rest, we can
have the windows mended; and do you keep all the sixpences you
earn for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he never did yet,&rdquo; said the
carpenter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the sixpence he earns, but
not a halfpenny goes into his own pocket: it goes every farthing
to his poor father and mother.&nbsp; Happy for them to have such
a son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More happy for him to have such a father and
mother,&rdquo; exclaimed the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their good days
they took all the best care of me that was to be had for love or
money, and would, if I would let them, go on paying for my
schooling now, falling as they be in the world; but I must learn
to mind the shop now.&nbsp; Good morning to you, sir; and thank
you kindly,&rdquo; said he to Mr. Somerville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where does this boy live, and who are his father
and mother?&nbsp; They cannot live in town,&rdquo; said Mr.
Somerville, &ldquo;or I should have heard of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are but just come into the town, please your
honour,&rdquo; said the carpenter.&nbsp; &ldquo;They lived
formerly upon Counsellor O&rsquo;Donnel&rsquo;s estate; but they
were ruined, please your honour, by taking a joint lease with a
man, who fell afterwards into bad company, ran out all he had, so
could not pay the landlord; and these poor people were forced to
pay his share and their own too, which almost ruined them.&nbsp;
They were obliged to give up the land; and now they have
furnished a little shop in this town with what goods they could
afford to buy with the money they got by the sale of their cattle
and stock.&nbsp; They have the good-will of all who know them;
and I am sure I hope they will do well.&nbsp; The boy is very
ready in the shop, though he said only that he could earn
sixpence a day.&nbsp; He writes a good hand, and is quick at
casting up accounts, for his age.&nbsp; Besides, he is likely to
do well in the world, because he is never in idle company, and
I&rsquo;ve known him since he was two foot high, and never heard
of his telling a lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an excellent character of the boy,
indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Somerville, &ldquo;and from his behaviour
this morning I am inclined to think that he deserves all your
praises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Somerville resolved to inquire more fully concerning this
poor family, and to attend to their conduct himself, fully
determined to assist them if he should find them such as they had
been represented.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this boy, whose name was Brian O&rsquo;Neill,
went to return the white pigeon to its owner.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have saved its life,&rdquo; said the woman to whom it belonged,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll make you a present of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Brian thanked her; and he from that day began to grow fond of the
pigeon.&nbsp; He always took care to scatter some oats for it in
his father&rsquo;s yard; and the pigeon grew so tame at last that
it would hop about the kitchen, and eat off the same trencher
with the dog.</p>
<p>Brian, after the shop was shut up at night, used to amuse
himself with reading some little books which the schoolmaster who
formerly taught him arithmetic was so good as to lend him.&nbsp;
Amongst these he one evening met with a little book full of the
history of birds and beasts; he looked immediately to see whether
the pigeon was mentioned amongst the birds, and, to his great
joy, he found a full description and history of his favourite
bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Brian, I see your schooling has not been thrown
away upon you; you like your book, I see, when you have no master
over you to bid you read,&rdquo; said his father, when he came in
and saw Brian reading his book very attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for having me taught to read, father,&rdquo;
said Brian.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve made a great discovery:
I&rsquo;ve found out in this book, little as it looks, father, a
most curious way of making a fortune; and I hope it will make
your fortune, father; and if you&rsquo;ll sit down, I&rsquo;ll
tell it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Neill, in hopes of pleasing his son rather than in
the expectation of having his fortune made, immediately sat down
to listen; and his son explained to him, that he had found in his
book an account of pigeons who carried notes and letters:
&ldquo;and, father,&rdquo; continued Brian, &ldquo;I find my
pigeon is of this sort; and I intend to make my pigeon carry
messages.&nbsp; Why should not he?&nbsp; If other pigeons have
done so before him, I think he is as good, and, I daresay, will
be as easy to teach as any pigeon in the world.&nbsp; I shall
begin to teach him to-morrow morning; and then, father, you know
people often pay a great deal for sending messengers; and no boy
can run, no horse can gallop, so fast as a bird can fly;
therefore the bird must be the best messenger, and I should be
paid the best price.&nbsp; Hey, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, to be sure, my boy,&rdquo; said his father,
laughing; &ldquo;I wish you may make the best messenger in
Ireland of your pigeon; but all I beg, my dear boy, is that you
won&rsquo;t neglect our shop for your pigeon; for I&rsquo;ve a
notion we have a better chance of making a fortune by the shop
than by the white pigeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brian never neglected the shop; but in his leisure hours he
amused himself with training his pigeon; and after much patience
he at last succeeded so well, that one day he went to his father
and offered to send him word by his pigeon what beef was a pound
in the market of Ballynagrish, where he was going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pigeon will be home long before me, father; and he
will come in at the kitchen window, and light upon the dresser;
then you must untie the little note which I shall have tied under
his left wing, and you&rsquo;ll know the price of beef
directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pigeon carried his message well; and Brian was much
delighted with his success.&nbsp; He soon was employed by the
neighbours, who were aroused by Brian&rsquo;s fondness of his
swift messenger; and soon the fame of the white pigeon was spread
amongst all who frequented the markets and fairs of
Somerville.</p>
<p>At one of these fairs a set of men of desperate fortunes met
to drink, and to concert plans of robberies.&nbsp; Their place of
meeting was at the ale-house of Mr. Cox, the man who, as our
readers may remember, was offended by Mr. Somerville&rsquo;s
hinting that he was fond of drinking and of quarrelling, and who
threatened vengeance for having been refused the new inn.</p>
<p>Whilst these men were talking over their scheme, one of them
observed, that one of their companions was not arrived.&nbsp;
Another said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s six miles
off,&rdquo; said another; and a third wished that he could make
him hear at that distance.&nbsp; This turned the discourse upon
the difficulties of sending messages secretly and quickly.&nbsp;
Cox&rsquo;s son, a lad of about nineteen, who was one of this
gang, mentioned the white carrier-pigeon, and he was desired to
try all means to get it into his possession.&nbsp; Accordingly,
the next day young Cox went to Brian O&rsquo;Neill, and tried, at
first by persuasion and afterwards by threats, to prevail upon
him to give up the pigeon.&nbsp; Brian was resolute in his
refusal, more especially when the petitioner began to bully
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t have it by fair means, we will by
foul,&rdquo; said Cox; and a few days afterwards the pigeon was
gone.&nbsp; Brian searched for it in vain&mdash;inquired from all
the neighbours if they had seen it, and applied, but to no
purpose, to Cox.&nbsp; He swore that he knew nothing about the
matter.&nbsp; But this was false, for it was he who during the
night-time had stolen the white pigeon.&nbsp; He conveyed it to
his employers, and they rejoiced that they had gotten it into
their possession, as they thought it would serve them for a
useful messenger.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more shortsighted than cunning.&nbsp; The very
means which these people took to secure secrecy were the means of
bringing their plots to light.&nbsp; They endeavoured to teach
the pigeon, which they had stolen, to carry messages for them in
a part of the country at some distance from Somerville; and when
they fancied that it had forgotten its former habits, and its old
master, they thought that they might venture to employ him nearer
home.&nbsp; The pigeon, however, had a better memory than they
imagined.&nbsp; They loosed him from a bag near the town of
Ballynagrish in hopes that he would stop at the house of
Cox&rsquo;s cousin, which was on its road between Ballynagrish
and Somerville.&nbsp; But the pigeon, though he had been
purposely fed at this house for a week before this trial, did not
stop there, but flew on to his old master&rsquo;s house in
Somerville, and pecked at the kitchen window, as he had formerly
been taught to do.&nbsp; His father, fortunately, was within
hearing, and poor Brian ran with the greatest joy to open the
window and to let him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, father, here&rsquo;s my white pigeon come back of
his own accord,&rdquo; exclaimed Brian; &ldquo;I must run and
show him to my mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this instant the pigeon
spread his wings, and Brian discovered under one of its wings a
small and very dirty looking billet.&nbsp; He opened it in his
father&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; The scrawl was scarcely legible;
but these words were at length deciphered:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thare are eight of uz sworn; I send yo at
botom thare names.&nbsp; We meat at tin this nite at my faders,
and have harms and all in radiness to brak into the grate
&rsquo;ouse.&nbsp; Mr. Summervill is to lye out to nite&mdash;kip
the pigeon untill to-morrow.&nbsp; For ever yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Murtagh
Cox</span>, <span class="smcap">Jun</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scarcely had they finished reading this note, than both father
and son exclaimed, &ldquo;Let us go and show it to Mr.
Somerville.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before they set out, they had, however,
the prudence to secure the pigeon, so that he should not be seen
by anyone but themselves.&nbsp; Mr. Somerville, in consequence of
this fortunate discovery, took proper measures for the
apprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his
house.&nbsp; When they were all safely lodged in the county gaol,
he sent for Brian O&rsquo;Neill and his father; and after
thanking them for the service they had done him, he counted out
ten bright guineas upon a table, and pushed them towards Brian,
saying, &ldquo;I suppose you know that a reward of ten guineas
was offered some weeks ago for the discovery of John Mac Dermod,
one of the eight men whom we have just taken up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Brian; &ldquo;I did not know it,
and I did not bring that note to you to get ten guineas, but
because I thought it was right.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to be
paid for doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my own boy,&rdquo; said his father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We thank you, sir; but we&rsquo;ll not take the money;
<i>I don&rsquo;t like to take the price of blood</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the difference, my good friends,&rdquo; said Mr.
Somerville, &ldquo;between vile informers and courageous, honest
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as to that, please your honour, though we are
poor, I hope we are honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, what is more,&rdquo; said Mr. Somerville, &ldquo;I
have a notion that you would continue to be honest, even if you
were rich.&nbsp; Will you, my good lad,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Somerville, after a moment&rsquo;s pause&mdash;&ldquo;will you
trust me with your pigeon a few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, and welcome, sir,&rdquo; said the boy, with a smile;
and he brought the pigeon to Mr. Somerville when it was dark, and
nobody saw him.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, Mr. Somerville called at
O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s house, and bid him and his son follow
him.&nbsp; They followed till he stopped opposite to the
bow-window of the new inn.&nbsp; The carpenter had just put up a
sign, which was covered over with a bit of carpeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go up the ladder, will you?&rdquo; said Mr. Somerville
to Brian, &ldquo;and pull that sign straight, for it hangs quite
crooked.&nbsp; There, now it is straight.&nbsp; Now pull off the
carpet, and let us see the new sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy pulled off the cover, and saw a white pigeon painted
upon the sign, and the name of O&rsquo;Neill in large letters
underneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care you do not tumble down and break your neck
upon this joyful occasion,&rdquo; said Mr. Somerville, who saw
that Brian&rsquo;s surprise was too great for his
situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come down from the ladder, and wish your
father joy of being master of the new inn called the &lsquo;White
Pigeon.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I wish him joy of having such a son as
you are.&nbsp; Those who bring up their children well, will
certainly be rewarded for it, be they poor or rich.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>THE
BIRTHDAY PRESENT.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mamma</span>,&rdquo; said Rosamond,
after a long silence, &ldquo;do you know what I have been
thinking of all this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear.&mdash;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mamma, about my cousin Bell&rsquo;s birthday; do
you know what day it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mother! don&rsquo;t you remember it&rsquo;s the
22nd of December; and her birthday is the day after
to-morrow?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you recollect now?&nbsp; But you
never remember about birthdays, mamma.&nbsp; That was just what I
was thinking of, that you never remember my sister Laura&rsquo;s
birthday, or&mdash;or&mdash;or <i>mine</i>, mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean my dear?&nbsp; I remember your
birthday perfectly well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! but you never <i>keep</i> it,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by keeping your birthday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma, you know very well&mdash;as Bell&rsquo;s
birthday is kept.&nbsp; In the first place, there is a great
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can Bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any
other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; nor I should not mind about the dinner, except the
mince-pies.&nbsp; But Bell has a great many nice things&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t mean nice eatable things, but nice new playthings,
given to her always on her birthday; and everybody drinks her
health, and she&rsquo;s so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stay, Rosamond, how you jumble things
together!&nbsp; Is it everybody&rsquo;s drinking her health that
makes her so happy? or the new playthings, or the nice mince
pies?&nbsp; I can easily believe that she is happy whilst she is
eating a mince pie, or whilst she is playing; but how does
everybody&rsquo;s drinking her health at dinner make her
happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosamond paused, and then said she did not know.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;the <i>nice new</i>
playthings, mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;But why the nice new playthings?&nbsp; Do you like them
only because they are <i>new</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not <i>only</i>&mdash;<i>I</i> do not like playthings
<i>only</i> because they are new; but Bell <i>does</i>, I
believe&mdash;for that puts me in mind&mdash;Do you know, mother,
she had a great drawer full of <i>old</i> playthings that she
never used, and she said that they were good for nothing, because
they were <i>old</i>; but I thought many of them were good for a
great deal more than the new ones.&nbsp; Now you shall be judge,
mamma; I&rsquo;ll tell you all that was in the drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Rosamond, thank you, not just now; I have not time
to listen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, mamma, the day after to-morrow I can show
you the drawer.&nbsp; I want you to judge very much, because I am
sure I was in the right.&nbsp; And, mother,&rdquo; added
Rosamond, stopping her as she was going out of the room,
&ldquo;will you&mdash;not now, but when you&rsquo;ve
time&mdash;will you tell me why you never keep my
birthday&mdash;why you never make any difference between that day
and any other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you, Rosamond&mdash;not now, but when you have
time to think about it&mdash;tell me why I should make any
difference between your birthday and any other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosamond thought, but she could not find out any reason;
besides, she suddenly recollected that she had not time to think
any longer; for there was a certain work-basket to be finished,
which she was making for her cousin Bell, as a present upon her
birthday.&nbsp; The work was at a stand for want of some
filigree-paper, and, as her mother was going out, she asked her
to take her with her, that she might buy some.&nbsp; Her sister
Laura went with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said Rosamond, as they were walking
along, &ldquo;what have you done with your
half-guinea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear! you will keep it for ever in your pocket.&nbsp;
You know, my godmother when she gave it to you, said you would
keep it longer than I should keep mine; and I know what she
thought by her look at the time.&nbsp; I heard her say something
to my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Laura, smiling; &ldquo;she whispered
so loud that I could not help hearing her too.&nbsp; She said I
was a little miser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did not you hear her say that I was very
<i>generous</i>? and she&rsquo;ll see that she was not
mistaken.&nbsp; I hope she&rsquo;ll be by when I give my basket
to Bell&mdash;won&rsquo;t it be beautiful?&nbsp; There is to be a
wreath of myrtle, you know, round the handle, and a frost ground,
and then the medallions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; interrupted her sister, for Rosamond,
anticipating the glories of her work-basket, talked and walked so
fast that she had passed, without perceiving it, the shop where
the filigree-paper was to be bought.&nbsp; They turned
back.&nbsp; Now it happened that the shop was the corner house of
a street, and one of the windows looked out into a narrow
lane.&nbsp; A coach full of ladies stopped at the door, just
before they went in, so that no one had time immediately to think
of Rosamond and her filigree-paper, and she went to the window
where she saw her sister Laura looking earnestly at something
that was passing in the lane.</p>
<p>Opposite to the window, at the door of a poor-looking house,
there was sitting a little girl weaving lace.&nbsp; Her bobbins
moved as quick as lightning, and she never once looked up from
her work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is not she very industrious?&rdquo; said
Laura; &ldquo;and very honest, too?&rdquo; added she in a minute
afterwards; for just then a baker with a basket of rolls on his
head passed, and by accident one of the rolls fell close to the
little girl.&nbsp; She took it up eagerly, looked at it as if she
was very hungry, then put aside her work, and ran after the baker
to return it to him.&nbsp; Whilst she was gone, a footman in a
livery, laced with silver, who belonged to the coach that stood
at the shop door, as he was lounging with one of his companions,
chanced to spy the weaving pillow, which she had left upon a
stone before the door.&nbsp; To divert himself (for idle people
do mischief often to divert themselves) he took up the pillow,
and entangled all the bobbins.&nbsp; The little girl came back
out of breath to her work; but what was her surprise and sorrow
to find it spoiled.&nbsp; She twisted and untwisted, placed and
replaced, the bobbins, while the footman stood laughing at her
distress.&nbsp; She got up gently, and was retiring into the
house, when the silver laced footman stopped her, saying,
insolently, &ldquo;Sit still, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go to my mother, sir,&rdquo; said the child;
&ldquo;besides, you have spoiled all my lace.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the brutal footman,
snatching her weaving-pillow again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you
to complain of me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he broke off, one after
another, all the bobbins, put them into his pocket, rolled her
weaving-pillow down the dirty lane, then jumped up behind his
mistress&rsquo; coach, and was out of sight in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Rosamond, no longer able to
restrain her indignation at this injustice; &ldquo;poor little
girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant her mother said to Rosamond&mdash;&ldquo;Come,
now, my dear, if you want this filigree paper, buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; said Rosamond; and the idea of what
her godmother and her cousin Bell would think of her generosity
rushed again upon her imagination.&nbsp; All her feelings of pity
were immediately suppressed.&nbsp; Satisfied with bestowing
another exclamation upon the &ldquo;<i>Poor little
girl</i>!&rdquo; she went to spend her half-guinea upon her
filigree basket.&nbsp; In the meantime, she that was called the
&ldquo;<i>little miser</i>&rdquo; beckoned to the poor girl, and,
opening the window, said, pointing to the cushion, &ldquo;Is it
quite spoiled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite! quite spoiled! and I can&rsquo;t, nor mother
neither, buy another; and I can&rsquo;t do anything else for my
bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few, but very few, tears fell as she said
this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much would another cost?&rdquo; said Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a great&mdash;<i>great</i> deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that?&rdquo; said Laura, holding up her
half-guinea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can buy another with that,&rdquo; said Laura,
dropping the half-guinea into her hand; and she shut the window
before the child could find words to thank her, but not before
she saw a look of joy and gratitude, which gave Laura more
pleasure probably than all the praise which could have been
bestowed upon her generosity.</p>
<p>Late on the morning of her cousin&rsquo;s birthday, Rosamond
finished her work-basket.&nbsp; The carriage was at the
door&mdash;Laura came running to call her; her father&rsquo;s
voice was heard at the same instant; so she was obliged to go
down with her basket but half wrapped up in silver paper&mdash;a
circumstance at which she was a good deal disconcerted; for the
pleasure of surprising Bell would be utterly lost if one bit of
the filigree should peep out before the proper time.&nbsp; As the
carriage went on, Rosamond pulled the paper to one side and to
the other, and by each of the four corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will never do, my dear,&rdquo; said her father, who
had been watching her operations.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid you
will never make a sheet of paper cover a box which is twice as
large as itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a box, father,&rdquo; said Rosamond, a little
peevishly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us look at this basket,&rdquo; said he, taking it
out of her unwilling hands, for she knew of what frail materials
it was made, and she dreaded its coming to pieces under her
father&rsquo;s examination.&nbsp; He took hold of the handle
rather roughly; when, starting off the coach seat, she cried,
&ldquo;Oh, sir! father! sir! you will spoil it indeed!&rdquo;
said she, with increased vehemence, when, after drawing aside the
veil of silver paper, she saw him grasp the myrtle wreathed
handle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, sir, you will spoil the poor
handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the use of <i>the poor handle</i>,&rdquo;
said her father, &ldquo;if we are not to take hold of it?&nbsp;
And pray,&rdquo; continued he, turning the basket round with his
finger and thumb, rather in a disrespectful manner, &ldquo;pray,
is this the thing you have been about all this week?&nbsp; I have
seen you all this week dabbling with paste and rags; I could not
conceive what you were about.&nbsp; Is this the thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; You think, then, that I have wasted my
time, because the basket is of no use; but then it is a present
for my Cousin Bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Cousin Bell will be very much obliged to you for a
present that is of no use.&nbsp; You had better have given her
the purple jar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father! I thought you had forgotten that&mdash;it
was two years ago; I&rsquo;m not so silly now.&nbsp; But Bell
will like the basket, I know, though it is of no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think Bell is sillier now than you were two
years ago,&mdash;well, perhaps that is true; but how comes it,
Rosamond, now that you are so wise, that you are fond of such a
silly person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i>, father?&rdquo; said Rosamond, hesitating,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am <i>very</i> fond of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say <i>very</i> fond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but I don&rsquo;t think I am at all fond of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have spent a whole week in making this thing
for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and all my half guinea besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you think her silly, and you are not fond of her at
all; and you say you know this thing will be of no use to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is her birthday, sir; and I am sure she will
<i>expect</i> something, and everybody else will give her
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your reason for giving is because she expects you
to give her something.&nbsp; And will you, or can you, or should
you, always give, merely because others <i>expect</i>, or because
somebody else gives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always?&mdash;no, not always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, only on birthdays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosamond, laughing: &ldquo;Now you are making a joke of me,
papa, I see; but I thought you liked that people should be
generous,&mdash;my godmother said that she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, full as well as your godmother; but we have
not yet quite settled what it is to be generous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it not generous to make presents?&rdquo; said
Rosamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the question which it would take up a great
deal of time to answer.&nbsp; But, for instance, to make a
present of a thing that you know can be of no use to a person you
neither love nor esteem, because it is her birthday, and because
everybody gives her something, and because she expects something,
and because your godmother says she likes that people should be
generous, seems to me, my dear Rosamond, to be, since I must say
it, rather more like folly than generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosamond looked down upon the basket, and was silent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I am a fool, am I?&rdquo; said she looking up at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you have made <i>one</i> mistake?&nbsp; No. If
you have sense enough to see your own mistakes, and can
afterwards avoid them, you will never be a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the carriage stopped, and Rosamond recollected that the
basket was uncovered.</p>
<p>Now we must observe, that Rosamond&rsquo;s father had not been
too severe upon Bell when he called her a silly girl.&nbsp; From
her infancy she had been humoured; and at eight years old she had
the misfortune to be a spoiled child.&nbsp; She was idle,
fretful, and selfish; so that nothing could make her happy.&nbsp;
On her birthday she expected, however, to be perfectly
happy.&nbsp; Everybody in the house tried to please her, and they
succeeded so well, that between breakfast and dinner she had only
six fits of crying.&nbsp; The cause of five of these fits no one
could discover: but the last, and most lamentable, was occasioned
by a disappointment about a worked muslin frock; and accordingly,
at dressing time, her maid brought it to her, exclaiming,
&ldquo;See here, miss, what your mamma has sent you on your
birthday.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a frock fit for a queen&mdash;if it
had but lace round the cuffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why has not it lace around the cuffs? mamma said it
should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but mistress was disappointed about the lace; it
is not come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not come home, indeed! and didn&rsquo;t they know it
was my birthday?&nbsp; But then I say I won&rsquo;t wear it
without the lace&mdash;I can&rsquo;t wear it without the lace,
and I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lace, however, could not be had; and Bell at length
submitted to let the frock be put on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Miss Bell, dry your eyes,&rdquo; said the maid
who <i>educated</i> her; &ldquo;dry your eyes, and I&rsquo;ll
tell you something that will please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo; said the child, pouting and
sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;but you must not tell that I told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;but if I am asked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if you are asked, you must tell the truth, to be
sure.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, tell me, though, and I&rsquo;ll never
tell&mdash;if I <i>am</i> asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the maid, &ldquo;your cousin
Rosamond is come, and has brought you the most
<i>beautifullest</i> thing you ever saw in your life; but you are
not to know anything about it till after dinner, because she
wants to surprise you; and mistress has put it into her wardrobe
till after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till after dinner!&rdquo; repeated Bell, impatiently;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait till then; I must see it this
minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; The maid refused her several times, till
Bell burst into another fit of crying, and the maid, fearing that
her mistress would be angry with <i>her</i>, if Bell&rsquo;s eyes
were red at dinner time, consented to show her the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pretty!&mdash;but let me have it in my own
hands,&rdquo; said Bell, as the maid held the basket up out of
her reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you must not touch it; for if you should spoil
it, what would become of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Become of you, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the spoiled
child, who never considered anything but her own immediate
gratification&mdash;&ldquo;Become of <i>you</i>, indeed! what
signifies that&mdash;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t spoil it; and I will
have it in my own hands.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t hold it down
for me directly, I&rsquo;ll tell that you showed it to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t snatch it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t indeed,&rdquo; said Bell; but she
had learned from her maid a total disregard of truth.&nbsp; She
snatched the basket the moment it was within her reach.&nbsp; A
struggle ensued, in which the handle and lid were torn off, and
one of the medallions crushed inwards, before the little fury
returned to her senses.</p>
<p>Calmed at this sight, the next question was, how she should
conceal the mischief which she had done.&nbsp; After many
attempts, the handle and lid were replaced; the basket was put
exactly in the same spot in which it had stood before, and the
maid charged the child, &ldquo;<i>to look as if nothing was the
matter</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We hope that both children and parents will here pause for a
moment to reflect.&nbsp; The habits of tyranny, meanness, and
falsehood, which children acquire from living with bad servants,
are scarcely ever conquered in the whole course of their future
lives.</p>
<p>After shutting up the basket they left the room, and in the
adjoining passage they found a poor girl waiting with a small
parcel in her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
business?&rdquo; said the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought home the lace, madam, that was bespoke
for the young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have, have you, at last?&rdquo; said Bell;
&ldquo;and pray why didn&rsquo;t you bring it
sooner?&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl was going to answer, but the maid
interrupted her, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Come, come, none of your
excuses; you are a little idle, good-for-nothing thing, to
disappoint Miss Bell upon her birthday.&nbsp; But now you have
brought it, let us look at it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl gave the lace without reply, and the maid
desired her to go about her business, and not to expect to be
paid; for that her mistress could not see anybody, <i>because</i>
she was in a room full of company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I call again, madam, this afternoon?&rdquo; said
the child, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless my stars!&rdquo; replied the maid,
&ldquo;what makes people so poor, I <i>wonders</i>!&nbsp; I wish
mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse, as I told her, and
not of these folks.&nbsp; Call again! yes, to be sure.&nbsp; I
believe you&rsquo;d call, call, call twenty times for
twopence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However ungraciously the permission to call again was granted,
it was received with gratitude.&nbsp; The little girl departed
with a cheerful countenance; and Bell teazed her maid till she
got her to sew the long wished-for lace upon her cuffs.</p>
<p>Unfortunate Bell!&mdash;All dinner time passed, and people
were so hungry, so busy, or so stupid, that not an eye observed
her favourite piece of finery.&nbsp; Till at length she was no
longer able to conceal her impatience, and turning to Laura, who
sat next to her, she said, &ldquo;You have no lace upon your
cuffs.&nbsp; Look how beautiful mine is!&mdash;is not it?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you wish your mamma could afford to give some like
it?&nbsp; But you can&rsquo;t get any if she would, for this was
made on purpose for me on my birthday, and nobody can get a bit
more anywhere, if they would give the world for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But cannot the person who made it,&rdquo; said Laura,
&ldquo;make any more like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; cried Bell; for she had already
learned, either from her maid or her mother, the mean pride which
values things not for being really pretty or useful, but for
being such as nobody else can procure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody can
get any like it, I say,&rdquo; repeated Bell; &ldquo;nobody in
all London can make it but one person, and that person will never
make a bit for anybody but me, I am sure.&nbsp; Mamma won&rsquo;t
let her, if I ask her not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Laura, coolly, &ldquo;I do not
want any of it; you need not be so violent: I assure you that I
don&rsquo;t want any of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you do, though,&rdquo; said Bell, more
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Laura, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, in the bottom of your heart; but you say you
don&rsquo;t to plague me, I know,&rdquo; cried Bell, swelling
with disappointed vanity.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is pretty for all that,
and it cost a great deal of money too, and nobody shall have any
like it, if they cried their eyes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura received this declaration in silence&mdash;Rosamond
smiled; and at her smile the ill-suppressed rage of the spoiled
child burst forth into the seventh and loudest fit of crying
which had yet been heard on her birthday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my pet?&rdquo; cried her
mother; &ldquo;come to me, and tell me what&rsquo;s the
matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bell ran roaring to her mother; but no
otherwise explained the cause of her sorrow than by tearing the
fine lace with frantic gestures from her cuffs, and throwing the
fragments into her mother&rsquo;s lap.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! the lace,
child!&mdash;are you mad?&rdquo; said her mother, catching hold
of both her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your beautiful lace, my dear
love&mdash;do you know how much it cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how much it cost&mdash;it is not
beautiful, and I&rsquo;ll have none of it,&rdquo; replied Bell,
sobbing; &ldquo;for it is not beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is beautiful,&rdquo; retorted her mother;
&ldquo;I chose the pattern myself.&nbsp; Who has put it into your
head, child, to dislike it?&nbsp; Was it Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not Nancy, but <i>them</i>, mamma,&rdquo; said
Bell, pointing to Laura and Rosamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fie! don&rsquo;t <i>point</i>,&rdquo; said her
mother, putting down her stubborn finger; &ldquo;nor say
<i>them</i>, like Nancy; I am sure you misunderstood.&nbsp; Miss
Laura, I am sure, did not mean any such thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam; and I did not say any such thing, that I
recollect,&rdquo; said Laura, gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, no,
indeed!&rdquo; cried Rosamond, warmly, rising in her
sister&rsquo;s defence.</p>
<p>No defence or explanation, however, was to be heard, for
everybody had now gathered round Bell, to dry her tears, and to
comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs.&nbsp;
They succeeded so well, that in about a quarter of an hour the
young lady&rsquo;s eyes, and the reddened arches over her
eyebrows came to their natural colour; and the business being
thus happily hushed up, the mother, as a reward to her daughter
for her good humour, begged that Rosamond would now be so good as
to produce her &ldquo;charming present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosamond, followed by all the company, amongst whom, to her
great joy, was her godmother, proceeded to the dressing
room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I am sure,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;Bell
will be surprised, and my godmother will see she was right about
my generosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doors of the wardrobe were opened with due ceremony, and
the filigree basket appeared in all its glory.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
this is a charming present, indeed!&rdquo; said the godmother,
who was one of the company; &ldquo;<i>my</i> Rosamond knows how
to make presents.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as she spoke, she took hold of
the basket, to lift it down to the admiring audience.&nbsp;
Scarcely had she touched it, when, lo! the basket fell to the
ground, and only the handle remained in her hand.&nbsp; All eyes
were fixed upon the wreck.&nbsp; Exclamations of sorrow were
heard in various tones; and &ldquo;Who can have done this?&rdquo;
was all that Rosamond could say.&nbsp; Bell stood in sullen
silence, which she obstinately preserved in the midst of the
inquiries that were made about the disaster.</p>
<p>At length the servants were summoned, and amongst them, Nancy,
Miss Bell&rsquo;s maid and governess.&nbsp; She affected much
surprise when she saw what had befallen the basket, and declared
that she knew nothing of the matter, but that she had seen her
mistress in the morning put it quite safe into the wardrobe; and
that, for her part, she had never touched it, or thought of
touching it, in her born days.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor Miss Bell,
neither, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;I can answer for her; for she never
knew of its being there, because I never so much as mentioned it
to her, that there was such a thing in the house, because I knew
Miss Rosamond wanted to surprise her with the secret; so I never
mentioned a sentence of it&mdash;did I, Miss Bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell, putting on the deceitful look which her maid had taught
her, answered boldly, &ldquo;<i>No</i>;&rdquo; but she had hold
of Rosamond&rsquo;s hand, and at the instant she uttered this
falsehood she squeezed it terribly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you
squeeze my hand so?&rdquo; said Rosamond, in a low voice;
&ldquo;what are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of!&rdquo; cried Bell, turning angrily;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of anything,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve nothing
to be afraid about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I did not say you had,&rdquo; whispered Rosamond;
&ldquo;but only if you did by accident&mdash;you know what I
mean&mdash;I should not be angry if you did&mdash;only say
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I did not!&rdquo; cried Bell, furiously;
&ldquo;Mamma, mamma!&nbsp; Nancy! my cousin Rosamond won&rsquo;t
believe me!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s very hard.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
rude, and I won&rsquo;t bear it&mdash;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, love.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody suspects you, darling,&rdquo; said her mother;
&ldquo;but she has too much sensibility.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t cry,
love; nobody suspected you.&nbsp; But you know,&rdquo; continued
she, turning to the maid, &ldquo;somebody must have done this,
and I must know how it was done.&nbsp; Miss Rosamond&rsquo;s
charming present must not be spoiled in this way, in my house,
without my taking proper notice of it.&nbsp; I assure you I am
very angry about it, Rosamond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosamond did not rejoice in her anger, and had nearly made a
sad mistake by speaking aloud her thoughts&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I was
very foolish</i>&mdash;&rdquo; she began and stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; cried the maid, suddenly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture to say I know who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said everyone, eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Bell, trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, miss, don&rsquo;t you recollect that little girl
with the lace, that we saw peeping about in the passage?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure she must have done it; for here she was by herself
half an hour or more, and not another creature has been in
mistress&rsquo; dressing-room, to my certain knowledge, since
morning.&nbsp; Those sort of people have so much curiosity.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure she must have been meddling with it,&rdquo; added
the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s the thing,&rdquo; said the
mistress, decidedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Miss Rosamond, for your
comfort she shall never come into my house again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would not comfort me at all,&rdquo; said
Rosamond; &ldquo;besides, we are not sure that she did it, and
if&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; A single knock at the door was heard at
this instant.&nbsp; It was the little girl, who came to be paid
for her lace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call her in,&rdquo; said the lady of the house;
&ldquo;let us see her directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid, who was afraid that the girl&rsquo;s innocence would
appear if she were produced, hesitated; but upon her mistress
repeating her commands, she was forced to obey.&nbsp; The girl
came in with a look of simplicity; but when she saw a room full
of company she was a little abashed.&nbsp; Rosamond and Laura
looked at her and one another with surprise, for it was the same
little girl whom they had seen weaving lace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not it she?&rdquo; whispered Rosamond to her
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is; but hush,&rdquo; said Laura, &ldquo;she
does not know us.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say a word, let us hear what
she will say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura got behind the rest of the company as she spoke, so that
the little girl could not see her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vastly well!&rdquo; said Bell&rsquo;s mother; &ldquo;I
am waiting to see how long you will have the assurance to stand
there with that innocent look.&nbsp; Did you ever see that basket
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>, <i>Ma&rsquo;am</i>!&rdquo; cried the maid;
&ldquo;and what else do you know about it?&nbsp; You had better
confess it at once, and mistress, perhaps, will say no more about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do confess it,&rdquo; added Bell, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confess what, madam?&rdquo; said the little girl;
&ldquo;I never touched the basket, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never <i>touched</i> it; but you confess,&rdquo;
interrupted Bell&rsquo;s mother, &ldquo;that you <i>did see</i>
it before.&nbsp; And, pray, how came you to see it?&nbsp; You
must have opened my wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the little girl;
&ldquo;but I was waiting in the passage, ma&rsquo;am, and this
door was partly open; and looking at the maid, you know, I could
not help seeing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how could you see through the doors of my
wardrobe?&rdquo; rejoined the lady.</p>
<p>The maid, frightened, pulled the little girl by the
sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;where did you
see this basket?&rdquo;&nbsp; Another stronger pull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it, madam, in her hands,&rdquo; looking at the
maid; &ldquo;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what became of it afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;&mdash;hesitating&mdash;&ldquo;miss
pulled, and by accident&mdash;I believe, I saw,
ma&rsquo;am&mdash;miss, you know what I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know&mdash;I do not know; and if I did, you
had no business there; and mamma won&rsquo;t believe you, I am
sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everybody else, however, did believe; and
their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her feel
rather ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you all look at me so for?&nbsp; Why do you all
look so?&nbsp; And am I to be put to shame on my birthday?&rdquo;
cried she, bursting into a roar of passion; &ldquo;and all for
this nasty thing!&rdquo; added she, pushing away the remains of
the basket, and looking angrily at Rosamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bell!&nbsp; Bell!&nbsp; O, fie! fie!&mdash;Now I am
ashamed of you; that&rsquo;s quite rude to your cousin,&rdquo;
said her mother, who was more shocked at her daughter&rsquo;s
want of politeness than at her falsehood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take her
away, Nancy, till she has done crying,&rdquo; added she to the
maid, who accordingly carried off her pupil.</p>
<p>Rosamond, during this scene, especially at the moment when her
present was pushed away with such disdain, had been making
reflections upon the nature of true generosity.&nbsp; A smile
from her father, who stood by, a silent spectator of the
catastrophe of the filigree basket, gave rise to these
reflections; nor were they entirely dissipated by the condolence
of the rest of the company, nor even by the praises of her
godmother, who, for the purpose of condoling with her, said,
&ldquo;Well, my dear Rosamond, I admire your generous
spirit.&nbsp; You know I prophesied that your half-guinea would
be gone the soonest.&nbsp; Did I not, Laura?&rdquo; said she,
appealing, in a sarcastic tone, to where she thought Laura
was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is Laura?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Laura came forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are too
<i>prudent</i> to throw away your money like your sister.&nbsp;
Your half-guinea, I&rsquo;ll answer for it, is snug in your
pocket&mdash;Is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; answered she, in a low voice.</p>
<p>But low as the voice of Laura was, the poor little lace-girl
heard it; and now, for the first time, fixing her eyes upon
Laura, recollected her benefactress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
that&rsquo;s the young lady!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a tone of
joyful gratitude, &ldquo;the good, good young lady, who gave me
the half-guinea, and would not stay to be thanked for it; but I
<i>will</i> thank her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The half-guinea, Laura!&rdquo; said her
godmother.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, madam, if you please,&rdquo; said
the little girl.</p>
<p>It was not in expectation of being praised for it, that Laura
had been generous, and therefore everybody was really touched
with the history of the weaving-pillow; and whilst they praised,
felt a certain degree of respect, which is not always felt by
those who pour forth eulogiums.&nbsp; <i>Respect</i> is not an
improper word, even applied to a child of Laura&rsquo;s age; for
let the age or situation of the person be what it may, they
command respect who deserve it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, madam!&rdquo; said Rosamond to her godmother,
&ldquo;now you see&mdash;you see she is <i>not</i> a little
miser.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s better than wasting half
a guinea upon a filigree basket; is it not, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
said she, with an eagerness which showed that she had forgotten
all her own misfortunes in sympathy with her sister.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is being <i>really generous</i>, father, is it
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rosamond,&rdquo; said her father, and he kissed
her; &ldquo;this <i>is</i> being really generous.&nbsp; It is not
only by giving away money that we can show generosity; it is by
giving up to others anything that we like ourselves: and
therefore,&rdquo; added he, smiling, &ldquo;it is really generous
of you to give your sister the thing you like best of all
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing I like the best of all others, father,&rdquo;
said Rosamond, half pleased, half vexed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
that, I wonder?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean <i>praise</i>, do you,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, you must decide that yourself,
Rosamond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said she, ingenuously, &ldquo;perhaps
it <i>was</i> <span class="GutSmall">ONCE</span> the thing I
liked best; but the pleasure I have just felt makes me like
something else much better.&rdquo;</p>

MONTEM.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Extracted from the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Courier</i>&rdquo; <i>of May</i>, 1799.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Yesterday</span> this triennial
ceremony took place, with which the public are too well
acquainted to require a particular description.&nbsp; A
collection, called Salt, is taken from the public, which forms a
purse, to support the Captain of the School in his studies at
Cambridge.&nbsp; This collection is made by the Scholars, dressed
in fancy dresses, all round the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock, the youths being assembled in
their habiliments at the College, the Royal Family set off from
the Castle to see them, and, after walking round the Courtyard,
they proceeded to Salt Hill in the following order:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Majesty, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,
and the Earl of Uxbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and
Cumberland, Earl Morton, and General Gwynne, all on horseback,
dressed in the Windsor uniform, except the Prince of Wales, who
wore a suit of dark blue, and a brown surtout over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then followed the Scholars, preceded by the Marechal
Serjeant, the Musicians of the Staffordshire Band, and Mr. Ford,
Captain of the Seminary, the Serjeant Major, Serjeants, Colonels,
Corporals, Musicians, Ensign, Lieutenant, Steward, Salt Bearers,
Polemen, and Runners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cavalcade was brought up by her Majesty and her
amiable daughters in two carriages, and a numerous company of
equestrians and pedestrians, all eager to behold their Sovereign
and his family.&nbsp; Among the former, Lady Lade was foremost in
the throng; only two others dared venture their persons on
horseback in such a multitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King and Royal Family were stopped on Eton Bridge
by Messrs. Young and Mansfield, the Salt Bearers, to whom their
Majesties delivered their customary donation of fifty guineas
each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Salt Hill, his Majesty, with his usual affability,
took upon himself to arrange the procession round the Royal
carriages; and even when the horses were taken off, with the
assistance of the Duke of Kent, fastened the traces round the
pole of the coaches, to prevent any inconvenience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An exceeding heavy shower of rain coming on, the Prince
took leave, and went to the &lsquo;Windmill Inn,&rsquo; till it
subsided.&nbsp; The King and his attendants weathered it out in
their great-coats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the young gentlemen walked round the carriage,
Ensign Vince and the Salt Bearers proceeded to the summit of the
hill; but the wind being boisterous, he could not exhibit his
dexterity in displaying his flag, and the space being too small
before the carriages, from the concourse of spectators, the King
kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under such
inconvenience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their Majesties and the Princesses then returned home,
the King occasionally stopping to converse with the Dean of
Windsor, the Earl of Harrington, and other noblemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scholars partook of an elegant dinner at the
&lsquo;Windmill Inn,&rsquo; and in the evening walked on Windsor
Terrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of
Cumberland, after taking leave of their Majesties, set off for
town, and honoured the Opera House with their presence in the
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The profit arising from the Salt collected, according
to account, amounted to 800 pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Stadtholder, the Duke of Gordon, Lord and Lady
Melbourne, Viscount Brome, and a numerous train of fashionable
nobility, were present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following is an account of their dresses, made as
usual, very handsomely, by Mrs. Snow, milliner, of
Windsor:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ford, Captain, with eight Gentlemen to attend him
as servitors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Sarjeant, Marechal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Bradith, Colonel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Plumtree,
Lieutenant.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Vince, Ensign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Young, College Salt Bearer; white and gold dress,
rich satin bag, covered with gold netting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mansfield, Oppidan, white, purple, and orange
dress, trimmed with silver; rich satin bag, purple and silver:
each carrying elegant poles, with gold and silver cord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keity, yellow and black velvet; helmet trimmed with
silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bartelot, plain mantle and sandals, Scotch bonnet,
a very Douglas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Knapp, flesh-colour and blue;
Spanish hat and feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ripley, rose-colour; helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Islip (being in mourning), a scarf; helmet, black
velvet; and white satin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Tomkins, violet and
silver; helmet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Thackery, lilac and
silver; Roman Cap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Drury, mazarin blue;
fancy cap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Davis, slate-colour and
straw.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Routh, pink and silver,
Spanish hat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Curtis, purple, fancy
cap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mr. Lloyd, blue; ditto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the conclusion of the ceremony the Royal Family
returned to Windsor, and the boys were all sumptuously
entertained at the tavern at Salt Hill.&nbsp; About six in the
evening all the boys returned in the order of procession, and,
marching round the great square of Eton, were dismissed.&nbsp;
The captain then paid his respects to the Royal Family, at the
Queen&rsquo;s Lodge, Windsor, previously to his departure for
King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, to defray which expense the
produce of the Montem was presented to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day concluded by a brilliant promenade of beauty,
rank, and fashion, on Windsor Terrace, enlivened by the
performance of several bands of music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The origin of the procession is from the custom by
which the Manor was held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The custom of hunting the Ram belonged to Eton College,
as well as the custom of Salt; but it was discontinued by Dr.
Cook, late Dean of Ely.&nbsp; Now this custom we know to have
been entered on the register of the Royal Abbey of Bec, in
Normandy, as one belonging to the Manor of East or Great Wrotham,
in Norfolk, given by Ralph de Toni to the Abbey of Bec, and was
as follows:&mdash;When the harvest was finished the tenants were
to have half an acre of barley, and a ram let loose; and if they
caught him he was their own to make merry with; but if he escaped
from them he was the Lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Etonians, in order
to secure the ram, houghed him in the Irish fashion, and then
attacked him with great clubs.&nbsp; The cruelty of this
proceeding brought it into disuse, and now it exists no
longer.&mdash;See Register of the Royal Abbey of Bec, folio
58.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the dissolution of the alien priories, in 1414,
by the Parliament of Leicester, they remained in the Crown till
Henry VI., who gave Wrotham Manor to Eton College; and if the
Eton Fellows would search, they would perhaps find the Manor in
their possession, that was held by the custom of Salt.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>SCENE I.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Bar of the</i>
&ldquo;<i>Windmill Inn</i>&rdquo; <i>at Salt Hill</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mr</span>.
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Newington</span>, <i>the
Landlord and Landlady</i>.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an unpossibility, Mr.
Newington; and that&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; Say no more about it;
&rsquo;tis an unpossibility in the natur of things.&nbsp; (<i>She
ranges jellies</i>, <i>etc.</i>, <i>in the Bar</i>.)&nbsp; And
pray, do you take your great old fashioned tankard, Mr.
Newington, from among my jellies and confectioneries.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i> (<i>takes his tankard and drinks</i>).&nbsp;
Anything for a quiet life.&nbsp; If it is an impossibility,
I&rsquo;ve no more to say; only, for the soul of me, I
can&rsquo;t see the great unpossibility, wife.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; Wife, indeed!&mdash;wife!&mdash;wife!
wife every minute.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Heyday!&nbsp; Why, what a plague would
you have me call you?&nbsp; The other day you quarrelled with me
for calling you Mrs. Landlady.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; To be sure I did, and very proper in me
I should.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve turned off three waiters and five
chambermaids already, for screaming after me <i>Mrs.
Landlady</i>! <i>Mrs. Landlady</i>!&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis all your
ill manners.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Ill manners!&nbsp; Why, if I may be so
bold, if you are not Mrs. Landlady, in the name of wonder what
are you?</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; Mrs. Newington, Mr. Newington.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i> (<i>drinks</i>).&nbsp; Mrs. Newington, Mr.
Newington drinks your health; for I suppose I must not be
landlord any more in my own house (<i>shrugs</i>).</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; Oh, as to that, I have no objections
nor impediments to your being called <i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; You
look it, and become it very proper.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Why, yes, indeed, thank my tankard, I
do look it, and become it, and am nowise ashamed of it; but
everyone to their mind, as you, wife, don&rsquo;t fancy the being
called Mrs. Landlady.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; To be sure I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Why,
when folks hear the old fashioned cry of Mrs. Landlady! Mrs.
Landlady! who do they expect, think you, to see, but an
overgrown, fat, featherbed of a woman, coming waddling along with
her thumbs sticking on each side of her apron, o&rsquo; this
fashion?&nbsp; Now, to see me coming, nobody would take me to be
a landlady.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Very true, indeed, wife&mdash;Mrs.
Newington, I mean&mdash;I ask pardon; but now to go on with what
we were saying about the unpossibility of letting that old lady,
and the civil-spoken young lady there above, have them there
rooms for another day.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Newington, let me hear no more
about that old gentlewoman, and that civil-spoken young
lady.&nbsp; Fair words cost nothing; and I&rsquo;ve a notion
that&rsquo;s the cause they are so plenty with the young
lady.&nbsp; Neither o&rsquo; them, I take it, by what
they&rsquo;ve ordered since their coming into the house, are such
grand folk, that one need be so <i>petticular</i> about them.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Why, they came only in a chaise and
pair, to be sure; I can&rsquo;t deny that.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; But, bless my stars! what signifies
talking?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know, as well as I do, Mr.
Newington, that to-morrow is Eton Montem, and that if we had
twenty times as many rooms and as many more to the back of them,
it would not be one too many for all the company we&rsquo;ve a
right to expect, and those the highest quality of the land?&nbsp;
Nay, what do I talk of to-morrow? isn&rsquo;t my Lady Piercefield
and suite expected? and, moreover, Mr. and Miss Bursal&rsquo;s to
be here, and will call for as much in an hour as your
civil-spoken young lady in a twelvemonth, I reckon.&nbsp; So, Mr.
Newington, if you don&rsquo;t think proper to go up and inform
the ladies above, that the Dolphin rooms are not for them, I must
<i>speak</i> myself, though &rsquo;tis a thing I never do when I
can help it.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; She not like to
speak!&nbsp; (<i>Aloud</i>.)&nbsp; My dear, you can speak a power
better than I can; so take it all upon yourself, if you please;
for, old-fashioned as I and my tankard here be, I can&rsquo;t
make a speech that borders on the uncivil order, to a lady like,
for the life and lungs of me.&nbsp; So, in the name of goodness,
do you go up, Mrs. Newington.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; And so I will, Mr. Newington.&nbsp;
Help ye!&nbsp; Civilities and rarities are out o&rsquo; season
for them that can&rsquo;t pay for them in this world; and very
proper.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exit Landlady</i>.]</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; And very proper!&nbsp; Ha! who comes
yonder?&nbsp; The Eton chap who wheedled me into lending him my
best hunter last year, and was the ruination of him; but that
must be paid for, wheedle or no wheedle; and, for the matter of
wheedling, I&rsquo;d stake this here Mr. Wheeler, that is making
up to me, do you see, against e&rsquo;er a boy, or hobbledehoy,
in all Eton, London, or Christendom, let the other be who he
will.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Wheeler</span>.</p>
<p><i>Wheeler</i>.&nbsp; A fine day, Mr. Newington.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; A fine day, Mr. Wheeler.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; And I hope, for <i>your</i> sake, we may
have as fine a day for the Montem to-morrow.&nbsp; It will be a
pretty penny in your pocket!&nbsp; Why, all the world will be
here; and (looking round at the jellies, etc.) so much the better
for them; for here are good things enough, and enough for
them.&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s the best thing of all, the good old
tankard still; not empty, I hope.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Not empty, I hope.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
to you, Mr. Wheeler.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Mr. Wheeler!&mdash;<i>Captain</i> Wheeler,
if you please.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; <i>You</i>, Captain Wheeler!&nbsp; Why,
I thought in former times it was always the oldest scholar at
Eton that was Captain at the Montems; and didn&rsquo;t Mr. Talbot
come afore you?</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Not at all; we came on the same day.&nbsp;
Some say I came first; some say Talbot.&nbsp; So the choice of
which of us is to be captain is to be put to the vote amongst the
lads&mdash;most votes carry it; and I have most votes, I fancy;
so I shall be captain, to-morrow, and a pretty deal of
<i>salt</i> <a name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139"
class="citation">[139]</a> I reckon I shall pocket.&nbsp; Why,
the collection at the last Montem, they say, came to a plump
thousand!&nbsp; No bad thing for a young fellow to set out with
for Oxford or Cambridge&mdash;hey?</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; And no bad thing, before he sets out
for Cambridge or Oxford, &rsquo;twould be for a young gentleman
to pay his debts.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Debts!&nbsp; Oh, time enough for
that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a little account with you in horses, I
know; but that&rsquo;s between you and me, you
know&mdash;mum.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Mum me no mums, Mr. Wheeler.&nbsp;
Between you and me, my best hunter has been ruinationed; and I
can&rsquo;t afford to be mum.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;ll take no
offence if I speak; and as you&rsquo;ll set off to-morrow, as
soon as the Montem&rsquo;s over, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to
settle with me some way or other to-day, as we&rsquo;ve no other
time.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; No time so proper, certainly.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the little account?&mdash;I have money sent me for
my Montem dress, and I can squeeze that much out of it.&nbsp; I
came home from Eton on purpose to settle with you.&nbsp; But as
to the hunter, you must call upon Talbot&mdash;do you understand?
to pay for him; for though Talbot and I had him the same day,
&rsquo;twas Talbot did for him, and Talbot must pay.&nbsp; I
spoke to him about it, and charged him to remember you; for I
never forget to speak a good word for my friends.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; So I perceive.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make bold just to give you my
opinion of these jellies whilst you are getting my account, Mr.
Newington.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>He swallows down a jelly or
two</i>&mdash;<i>Landlord is going</i>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Talbot</span>.</p>
<p><i>Talbot</i>.&nbsp; Hallo, Landlord! where are making off so
fast?&nbsp; Here, your jellies are all going as fast as
yourself.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; Talbot!&mdash;I wish I was
a hundred miles off.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; You are heartily welcome, Mr.
Talbot.&nbsp; A good morning to you, sir; I&rsquo;m glad to see
you&mdash;very glad to see you, Mr. Talbot.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Then shake hands, my honest landlord.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Talbot</i>, <i>in shaking hands
with him</i>, <i>puts a purse into the landlord&rsquo;s
hands</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here?&nbsp; Guineas?</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; The hunter, you know; since Wheeler
won&rsquo;t pay, I must&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Good
morning.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; What a fool!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Landlord</i>, <i>as Talbot is
going</i>, <i>catches hold of his coat</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Hold, Mr. Talbot, this won&rsquo;t
do!</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Well, then, my watch
must go.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Nay, nay! but you are in such a hurry
to pay&mdash;you won&rsquo;t hear a man.&nbsp; Half this is
enough for your share o&rsquo; the mischief, in all
conscience.&nbsp; Mr. Wheeler, there, had the horse on the same
day.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; But Bursal&rsquo;s my witness&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Oh, say no more about witnesses; a
man&rsquo;s conscience is always his best witness, or his
worst.&nbsp; Landlord, take your money, and no more words.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; This is very genteel of you, Talbot.&nbsp;
I always thought you would do the genteel thing as I knew you to
be so generous and considerate.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t waste your fine speeches,
Wheeler, I advise you, this election time.&nbsp; Keep them for
Bursal or Lord John, or some of those who like them.&nbsp; They
won&rsquo;t go down with me.&nbsp; Good morning to you.&nbsp; I
give you notice, I&rsquo;m going back to Eton as fast as I can
gallop; and who knows what plain speaking may do with the Eton
lads?&nbsp; I may be captain yet, Wheeler.&nbsp; Have a
care!&nbsp; Is my horse ready there?</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Talbot&rsquo;s horse, there!&nbsp;
Mr. Talbot&rsquo;s horse, I say.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Talbot sings</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He carries weight&mdash;he rides a
race&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Tis for a thousand pound!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Exit Talbot</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; And, dear me! I shall be left
behind.&nbsp; A horse for me, pray; a horse for Mr. Wheeler!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Exit Wheeler</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i> (<i>calls very loud</i>).&nbsp; Mr.
Talbot&rsquo;s horse!&nbsp; Hang the hostler!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
saddle him myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Exit Landlord</i>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE II.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A Dining room in the Inn at Salt
Hill</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mrs.
Talbot</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Louisa</span>.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i> (<i>laughing</i>).&nbsp; With what an air Mrs.
Landlady made her exit!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talbot</i>.&nbsp; When I was young, they say, I was
proud; but I am humble enough now: these petty mortifications do
not vex me.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; It is well my brother was gone before
Mrs. Landlady made her entree; for if he had heard her rude
speech, he would at least have given her the retort
courteous.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i>&nbsp; Now tell me honestly, my
Louisa&mdash;You were, a few days ago, at Bursal House.&nbsp;
Since you have left it and have felt something of the difference
that is made in this world between splendour and no splendour,
you have never regretted that you did not stay there, and that
you did not bear more patiently with Miss Bursal&rsquo;s little
airs?</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; Never for a moment.&nbsp; At first Miss
Bursal paid me a vast deal of attention; but, for what reason I
know not, she suddenly changed her manner, grew first strangely
cold, then condescendingly familiar, and at last downright
rude.&nbsp; I could not guess the cause of these variations.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i> (<i>aside</i>) I guess the cause too
well.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; But as I perceived the lady was out of
tune, I was in haste to leave her.&nbsp; I should make a very
bad, and, I am sure, a miserable toad eater.&nbsp; I had much
rather, if I were obliged to choose, earn my own bread, than live
as toad eater with anybody.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i>&nbsp; Fine talking, dear Louisa!</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you believe me to be in
earnest, mother!&nbsp; To be sure, you cannot know what I would
do, unless I were put to the trial.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i>&nbsp; Nor you either, my dear.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>She sighs</i>, <i>and is
silent</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i> (<i>takes her mother&rsquo;s hand</i>).&nbsp;
What is the matter, dear mother?&nbsp; You used to say, that
seeing my brother always made you feel ten years younger; yet
even while he was here, you had, in spite of all your efforts to
conceal them, those sudden fits of sadness.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i>&nbsp; The Montem&mdash;is not it
to-morrow?&nbsp; Ay, but my boy is not sure of being captain.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; No; there is one Wheeler, who, as he
says, is most likely to be chosen captain.&nbsp; He has taken
prodigious pains to flatter and win over many to his
interest.&nbsp; My brother does not so much care about it; he is
not avaricious.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i>&nbsp; I love your generous spirit and his!
but, alas! my dear, people may live to want, and wish for money,
without being avaricious.&nbsp; I would not say a word to Talbot;
full of spirits as he was this morning, I would not say a word to
him, till after the Montem, of what has happened.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; And what has happened, dear mother?&nbsp;
Sit down,&mdash;you tremble.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i> (<i>sits down and puts a letter into
Louisa&rsquo;s hand</i>.)&nbsp; Read that, love.&nbsp; A
messenger brought me that from town a few hours ago.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i> (<i>reads</i>).&nbsp; &ldquo;By an express from
Portsmouth, we hear the <i>Bombay Castle</i> East Indiaman is
lost, with all your fortune on board.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>All</i>!&nbsp; I hope there is something left for you to live
upon.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i>&nbsp; About 150 pounds a year for us
all.</p>

it.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i> (<i>kneels down beside her</i>).&nbsp; Do not
speak so, dearest mother.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i>&nbsp; Enough for me, love!&nbsp; Yes,
enough, and too much for me.&nbsp; I am not thinking of
myself.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; Then, as to my brother, he has such
abilities, and such industry, he will make a fortune at the bar
for himself, most certainly.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Talb.</i>&nbsp; But his education is not
completed.&nbsp; How shall we provide him with money at
Cambridge?</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; This Montem.&nbsp; The last time the

money.</p>

<p><i>Miss Burs.</i>&nbsp; Mr. Bursal, can you inform me why Joe,

<p><i>Mr. Burs.</i> (<i>eating and speaking</i>).&nbsp; Yes, that
I can, child; because he is with his &rsquo;orses, where he ought

they cost me a pretty penny&mdash;more than their heads are
worth, and yours into the bargain; but I was resolved, as we were
to come to this Montem, to come in style.</p>
<p><i>Miss Burs.</i>&nbsp; In style, to be sure; for all the
world&rsquo;s to be here&mdash;the King, the Prince of

it; and I do love to see my children make a figure for their

There&rsquo;s your brother Jack, now.&nbsp; The extravagant dog!
he&rsquo;ll have such a dress as never was seen, I suppose, at

at Eton, and has more to spend, than my Lord John, though my Lord

<h4>SCENE III.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Landlady&rsquo;s
Parlour</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Landlady</span>&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Mr. Finsbury</span>, a man-milliner, with
bandboxes&mdash;a fancy cap, or helmet, with feathers, in the
Landlady&rsquo;s hand&mdash;a satin bag, covered with gold
netting, in the man-milliner&rsquo;s hand&mdash;a mantle hanging
over his arm.&nbsp; A rough looking Farmer is sitting with his
back towards them, eating bread and cheese, and reading a
newspaper.</p>
<p>Landlady.&nbsp; Well, this, to be sure, will be the best
dressed Montem that ever was seen at Eton; and you Lon&rsquo;on
gentlemen have the most fashionablest notions; and this is the
most elegantest fancy cap&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Finsbury</i>.&nbsp; Why, as you observe, ma&rsquo;m, that
is the most elegant fancy cap of them all.&nbsp; That is Mr.
Hector Hogmorton&rsquo;s fancy cap, ma&rsquo;m; and here,
ma&rsquo;m, is Mr. Saul&rsquo;s rich satin bag, covered with gold
net.&nbsp; He is college salt bearer, I understand, and has a
prodigious superb white and gold dress.&nbsp; But, in my humble
opinion, ma&rsquo;m, the marshal&rsquo;s white and purple and
orange fancy dress, trimmed with silver, will bear the bell;
though, indeed, I shouldn&rsquo;t say that,&mdash;for the
colonel&rsquo;s and lieutenant&rsquo;s, and ensign&rsquo;s, are
beautiful in the extreme.&nbsp; And, to be sure, nothing could be
better imagined than Mr. Marlborough&rsquo;s lilac and silver,
with a Roman cap.&nbsp; And it must be allowed that nothing in
nature can have a better effect than Mr. Drake&rsquo;s
flesh-colour and blue, with this Spanish hat, ma&rsquo;m, you
see.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>The farmer looks over his
shoulder from time to time during this speech</i>, <i>with
contempt</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Farmer</i> (<i>reads the newspaper</i>).&nbsp; French fleet
at sea&mdash;Hum!</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; O gemini: Mr. Drake&rsquo;s Spanish hat
is the sweetest, tastiest thing!&nbsp; Mr. Finsbury, I
protest&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Finsb.</i>&nbsp; Why, ma&rsquo;m, I knew a lady of your
taste couldn&rsquo;t but approve of it.&nbsp; My own invention
entirely, ma&rsquo;m.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s nothing to the
captain&rsquo;s cap, ma&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Indeed, ma&rsquo;m, Mr.
Wheeler, the captain that is to be, has the prettiest taste in
dress.&nbsp; To be sure, his sandals were my suggestion; but the
mantle he has the entire credit of, to do him justice; and when
you see it, ma&rsquo;m, you will be really surprised; for (for
contrast, and elegance, and richness, and lightness, and
propriety, and effect, and costume) you&rsquo;ve never yet seen
anything at all to be compared to Captain Wheeler&rsquo;s mantle,
ma&rsquo;m.</p>
<p><i>Farmer</i> (<i>to the Landlady</i>).&nbsp; Why, now, pray,
Mrs. Landlady, how long may it have been the fashion for
milliners to go about in men&rsquo;s clothes?</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i> (<i>aside to Farmer</i>).&nbsp; Lord, Mr.
Hearty, hush!&nbsp; This is Mr. Finsbury, the great
man-milliner.</p>
<p>Farm.&nbsp; The great man-milliner!&nbsp; This is a sight I
never thought to see in Old England.</p>
<p><i>Finsb.</i> (<i>packing up band boxes</i>).&nbsp; Well,
ma&rsquo;m, I&rsquo;m glad I have your approbation.&nbsp; It has
ever been my study to please the ladies.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i> (<i>throws a fancy mantle over his frieze
coat</i>).&nbsp; And is this the way to please the ladies, Mrs.
Landlady, nowadays?</p>
<p><i>Finsb.</i> (<i>taking off the mantle</i>).&nbsp; Sir, with
your leave&mdash;I ask pardon&mdash;but the least thing
detriments these tender colours; and as you have just been eating
cheese with your hands&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis my way to eat cheese with my
mouth, man.</p>
<p><i>Finsb.</i>&nbsp; <i>Man</i>!</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; I ask pardon&mdash;man-milliner, I
mean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Landlord</span>.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Why, wife!</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; Wife!</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; I ask pardon&mdash;Mrs. Newington, I
mean.&nbsp; Do you know who them ladies are that you have been
and turned out of the Dolphin?</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i> (<i>alarmed</i>).&nbsp; Not I, indeed.&nbsp;
Who are they, pray?&nbsp; Why, if they are quality it&rsquo;s no
fault of mine.&nbsp; It is their own fault for coming, like
scrubs, without four horses.&nbsp; Why, if quality will travel
the road this way, incognito, how can they expect to be known and
treated as quality?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis no fault of mine.&nbsp; Why
didn&rsquo;t you find out sooner who they were, Mr.
Newington?&nbsp; What else, in the &rsquo;versal world have you
to do, but to go basking about in the yards and places with your
tankard in your hand, from morning till night?&nbsp; What have
you else to ruminate, all day long, but to find out who&rsquo;s
who, I say?</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Clapper! clapper! clapper! like my mill in
a high wind, landlord.&nbsp; Clapper! clapper!
clapper!&mdash;enough to stun a body.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; That is not used to it; but use is all,
they say.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; Will you answer me, Mr.
Newington?&nbsp; Who are the grandees that were in the
Dolphin?&mdash;and what&rsquo;s become on them?</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Grandees was your own word, wife.&nbsp;
They be not to call grandees; but I reckon you&rsquo;d be sorry
not to treat &rsquo;em civil, when I tell you their name is
Talbot, mother and sister to our young Talbot, of Eton; he that
paid me so handsome for the hunter this very morning.</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; Mercy! is that all?&nbsp; What a
combustion for nothing in life!</p>
<p><i>Finsb.</i>&nbsp; For nothing in life, as you say,
ma&rsquo;m; that is, nothing in high life, I&rsquo;m sure,
ma&rsquo;m; nay, I dare a&rsquo;most venture to swear.&nbsp;
Would you believe it, Mr. Talbot is one of the few young
gentlemen of Eton that has not bespoke from me a fancy dress for
this grand Montem?</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; There, Mr. Newington; there&rsquo;s
your Talbot for you! and there&rsquo;s your grandees!&nbsp; O
trust me, I know your scrubs at first sight.</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Scrubs, I don&rsquo;t, nor can&rsquo;t,
nor won&rsquo;t call them that pay their debts honestly.&nbsp;
Scrubs, I don&rsquo;t, nor won&rsquo;t, nor can&rsquo;t, call
them that behave as handsome as young Mr. Talbot did here to me
this morning about the hunter.&nbsp; A scrub he is not,
wife.&nbsp; Fancy-dress or no fancy-dress, Mr. Finsbury, this
young gentleman is no scrub.</p>
<p><i>Finsb.</i>&nbsp; Dear me!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas not I said
<i>scrub</i>.&nbsp; Did I say scrub?</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; No matter if you did.</p>
<p><i>Finsb.</i>&nbsp; No matter, certainly; and yet it is a
matter; for I&rsquo;m confident I wouldn&rsquo;t for the world
leave it in anyone&rsquo;s power to say that I said&mdash;that I
called&mdash;any young gentleman of Eton a <i>scrub</i>!&nbsp;
Why, you know, sir, it might breed a riot!</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; And a pretty figure you&rsquo;d make in a
riot!</p>
<p><i>Landlady</i>.&nbsp; Pray let me hear nothing about riots in
my house.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Nor about scrubs.</p>
<p><i>Finsb.</i>&nbsp; But I beg leave to explain,
gentlemen.&nbsp; All I ventured to remark or suggest was, that as
there was some talk of Mr. Talbot&rsquo;s being captain
to-morrow, I didn&rsquo;t conceive how he could well appear
without any dress.&nbsp; That was all, upon my word and
honour.&nbsp; A good morning to you, gentlemen; it is time for me
to be off.&nbsp; Mrs. Newington, you were so obliging as to
promise to accommodate me with a return chaise as far as
Eton.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Finsbury bows and exit</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; A good day to you and your bandboxes.&nbsp;

<p><i>Landlord</i>.&nbsp; Mrs. Talbot&rsquo;s coming&mdash;stand

There&rsquo;s Bursal there, with his dead forty-five votes at
command; and Lord John with his&mdash;how many live friends?</p>
<p><i>Lord John</i> (<i>coolly</i>).&nbsp; Sir, I have fifty-six
friends, I believe.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Fifty-six friends, his lordship
believes&mdash;Wheeler inclusive, no doubt.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; That&rsquo;s as hereafter may be.</p>
<p><i>Wheeler</i>.&nbsp; Hereafter! Oh, fie, my <i>lud</i>!&nbsp;
You know your own Wheeler has, from the first minute he ever saw
you, been your fast friend.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Your fast friend from the first minute he
ever saw you, my lord! That&rsquo;s well hit, Wheeler; stick to
that; stick fast.&nbsp; Fifty-six friends, Wheeler
<i>in</i>clusive, hey, my lord! hey, my <i>lud</i>!</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; Talbot <i>ex</i>clusive, I find, contrary
to my expectations.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Ay, contrary to your expectations, you find
that Talbot is not a dog that will lick the dust: but then
there&rsquo;s enough of the true spaniel breed to be had for
whistling for; hey, Wheeler?</p>
<p><i>Bursal</i> (<i>aside to Wheeler</i>).&nbsp; A pretty
electioneerer.&nbsp; So much the better for you, Wheeler.&nbsp;
Why, unless he bought a vote, he&rsquo;d never win one, if he
talked from this to the day of judgment.</p>
<p><i>Wheeler</i> (<i>aside to Bursal</i>).&nbsp; And as he has
no money to buy votes&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;we are safe
enough.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; That&rsquo;s well done, Wheeler; fight the
by-battle there with Bursal.&nbsp; Now you are sure of the main
with Lord John.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; Sure! I never made Mr. Wheeler any
promise yet.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; O; I ask no promise from his lordship; we
are upon honour: I trust entirely to his lordship&rsquo;s good
nature and generosity, and to his regard for his own family; I
having the honour, though distantly, to be related.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; Related!&nbsp; How, Wheeler?</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Connected, I mean, which is next door, as
I may say, to being related.&nbsp; Related slipped out by
mistake; I beg pardon, my Lord John.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; Related!&mdash;a strange mistake,
Wheeler.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Overshot yourself, Wheeler; overshot
yourself, by all that&rsquo;s awkward.&nbsp; And yet, till now, I

<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Keep out of my hearing, Wheeler, lest I
should spoil sport.&nbsp; But never fear: you&rsquo;ll please
Bursal sooner than I shall.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t, for the soul of
me, bring myself to say that Bursal&rsquo;s not purse-proud, and
you can.&nbsp; Give you joy.</p>

<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; There was a time, Talbot&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; There was a time, my lord&mdash;to save
trouble and a long explanation&mdash;there was a time when you
liked Talbots better than spaniels; you understand me?</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; I have found it very difficult to
understand you of late, Mr. Talbot.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Yes, because you have used other
people&rsquo;s understandings instead of your own.&nbsp; Be
yourself, my lord.&nbsp; See with your own eyes, and hear with
your own ears, and then you&rsquo;ll find me still, what
I&rsquo;ve been these seven years; not your understrapper, your
hanger-on, your flatterer, but your friend!&nbsp; If you choose
to have me for a friend, here&rsquo;s my hand.&nbsp; I am your
friend, and you&rsquo;ll not find a better.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i> (<i>giving his hand</i>).&nbsp; You are a
strange fellow, Talbot; I thought I never could have forgiven you
for what you said last night.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; What? for I don&rsquo;t keep a register of
my sayings.&nbsp; Oh, it was something about gaming&mdash;Wheeler
was flattering your taste for it, and he put me into a
passion&mdash;I forget what I said.&nbsp; But, whatever it was,
I&rsquo;m sure it was well meant, and I believe it was well
said.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; But you laugh at me sometimes to my
face.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Would you rather I should laugh at you
behind your back?</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; But of all things in the world I hate to
be laughed at.&nbsp; Listen to me, and don&rsquo;t fumble in your
pockets while I&rsquo;m talking to you.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; I&rsquo;m fumbling for&mdash;oh, here it
is.&nbsp; Now, Lord John, I once did laugh at you behind your
back, and what&rsquo;s droll enough, it was at your back I
laughed.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a caricature I drew of you&mdash;I
really am sorry I did it; but &rsquo;tis best to show it to you
myself.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; It is all I can do to
forgive this.&nbsp; (<i>After a pause, he tears the
paper</i>.)&nbsp; I have heard of this caricature before; but I
did not expect, Talbot, that you would come and show it to me,
yourself, Talbot, so handsomely, especially at such a time as
this.&nbsp; Wheeler might well say you are a bad

mean; for I&rsquo;ll lay you a wager, you&rsquo;ve forget me; and
that&rsquo;s a shame for you, too; for out of the whole
posse-comitatus entirely now, you have not a stauncher friend
than Poor little Rory O&rsquo;Ryan.&nbsp; And a good right he has
to befriend you; for you stood by him when many who ought to have
known better were hunting him down for a wild Irishman.&nbsp; Now
that same wild Irishman has as much gratitude in him as any tame
Englishman of them all.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s be
talking sintimint; for, for my share I&rsquo;d not give a
bogberry a bushel for sintimint, when I could get anything
better.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; And pray, sir, what may a bogberry
be?</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Phoo! don&rsquo;t be playing the innocent,
now.&nbsp; Where have you lived all your life (I ask pardon, my
l<i>a</i>rd) not to know a bogberry when you see or hear of
it?&nbsp; (<i>Turns to Talbot</i>.)&nbsp; But what are ye
standing idling here for?&nbsp; Sure, there&rsquo;s Wheeler, and
Bursal along with him, canvassing out yonder at a terrible fine
rate.&nbsp; And haven&rsquo;t I been huzzaing for you there till
I&rsquo;m hoarse?&nbsp; So I am, and just stepped away to suck an
orange for my voice&mdash;(<i>sucks an orange</i>.)&nbsp; I am a
<i>thorough going</i> friend, at anyrate.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Now, Rory, you are the best fellow in the
world, and a <i>thorough going</i> friend; but have a care, or
you&rsquo;ll get yourself and me into some scrape, before you
have done with this violent <i>thorough going</i> work.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Never fear! never fear, man!&mdash;a warm
frind and a bitter enemy, that&rsquo;s my maxim.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Yes, but too warm a <i>friend</i> is as bad
as a bitter enemy.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Oh, never fear me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as cool
as a cucumber all the time; and whilst they <i>tink</i> I&rsquo;m
<i>tinking</i> of nothing in life but making a noise, I make my
own snug little remarks in prose and verse, as&mdash;now my voice
is after coming back to me, you shall hear, if you
<i>plase</i>.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; I do please.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; I call it Rory&rsquo;s song.&nbsp; Now,
mind, I have a verse for everybody&mdash;o&rsquo; the leading
lads, I mean; and I shall put &rsquo;em in or <i>lave</i>
&rsquo;em out, according to their inclinations and deserts,
<i>wise-a-wee</i> to you, my little <i>frind</i>.&nbsp; So you
comprehend it will be Rory&rsquo;s song, with variations.</p>

<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a stroke, in the first place,
for Wheeler,&mdash;you take it?</p>

<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Pooh, it is only Rory O&rsquo;Ryan, or the

O&rsquo;Ryan, alias O&rsquo;Ryan, the roaring lion; that&rsquo;s
a good one; put it about&mdash;Rory O&rsquo;Ryan, the roaring
lion, ha! ha! ha! but you don&rsquo;t take it&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t laugh, Wheeler.</p>
<p><i>Wheeler</i>.&nbsp; Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; O, upon my honour I do
laugh; ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; (<i>Aside</i>).&nbsp; It is the hardest
work to laugh at his wit.&nbsp; (<i>Aloud</i>.)&nbsp; Rory
O&rsquo;Ryan, the roaring lion&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; You know I
always laugh, Bursal, at your jokes&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;ready
to kill myself.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>sullenly</i>).&nbsp; You are easily killed,
then, if that much laughing will do the business.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>coughing</i>).&nbsp; Just
then&mdash;something stuck in my throat; I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>still sullen</i>).&nbsp; Oh, you need not beg
my pardon about the matter.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care whether you
laugh or no&mdash;not I.&nbsp; Now you have got Lord John to
declare for you, you are above laughing at my jokes, I
suppose.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; No, upon my word and honour, I <i>did</i>
laugh.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; A fig for your word and
honour.&nbsp; (<i>Aloud</i>.)&nbsp; I know I&rsquo;m of no
consequence now; but you&rsquo;ll remember, that if his lordship
has the honour of making you captain, he must have the honour to
pay for your captain&rsquo;s accoutrements; for I
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t pay the piper, I promise you, since I&rsquo;m
of no consequence.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Of no consequence!&nbsp; But, my dear
Bursal, what could put that into your head? that&rsquo;s the
strangest, oddest fancy.&nbsp; Of no consequence! Bursal, of no
consequence!&nbsp; Why, everybody that knows
anything&mdash;everybody that has seen Bursal House&mdash;knows
that you are of the greatest consequence, my dear Bursal.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>taking out his watch</i>, <i>and opening
it</i>, <i>looks at it</i>).&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;m of no
consequence.&nbsp; I wonder that rascal Finsbury is not come yet
with the dresses (<i>still looking at his watch</i>).</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; If Bursal takes it into
his head not to lend me the money to pay for my captain&rsquo;s
dress, what will become of me? for I have not a
shilling&mdash;and Lord John won&rsquo;t pay for me&mdash;and
Finsbury has orders not to leave the house till he is paid by
everybody.&nbsp; What will become of me?&mdash;(<i>bites his
nails</i>).</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; How I love to make him bite
his nails!&nbsp; (<i>Aloud</i>.)&nbsp; I know I&rsquo;m of no
consequence.&nbsp; (<i>Strikes his repeater</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; What a fine repeater that is of yours,
Bursal!&nbsp; It is the best I ever heard.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; So it well may be; for it cost a mint of
money.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; No matter to you what anything
costs.&nbsp; Happy dog as you are!&nbsp; You roll in money; and
yet you talk of being of no consequence.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; But I am not of half so much consequence as
Lord John&mdash;am I?</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Are you?&nbsp; Why, aren&rsquo;t you twice
as rich as he!</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Very true, but I&rsquo;m not
purse-proud.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; You purse-proud!&nbsp; I should never have
thought of such a thing.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Nor I, if Talbot had not used the word.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; But Talbot thinks everybody purse-proud
that has a purse.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; Well, this Wheeler does put
one into a good humour with one&rsquo;s self in spite of
one&rsquo;s teeth.&nbsp; (<i>Aloud</i>.)&nbsp; Talbot says blunt
things; but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s what you can call
clever&mdash;hey, Wheeler?</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Clever?&nbsp; Oh, not he.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; I think I could walk round him.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; To be sure you could.&nbsp; Why, do you
know, I&rsquo;ve quizzed him famously myself within this quarter
of an hour!</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Indeed! I wish I had been by.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; So do I, &rsquo;faith!&nbsp; It was the
best thing.&nbsp; I wanted, you see, to get him out of my way,
that I might have the field clear for electioneering
to-day.&nbsp; So I bowls up to him with a long face&mdash;such a
face as this.&nbsp; Mr. Talbot, do you know&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry
to tell you, here&rsquo;s Jack Smith has just brought the news
from Salt Hill.&nbsp; Your mother, in getting into the carriage,
slipped, and has <i>broke</i> her leg, and there she&rsquo;s
lying at a farmhouse, two miles off.&nbsp; Is not it true, Jack?
said I.&nbsp; I saw the farmer helping her in with my own eyes,
cries Jack.&nbsp; Off goes Talbot like an arrow.&nbsp; Quizzed
him, quizzed him! said I.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Ha! ha! ha! quizzed him indeed, with all
his cleverness; that was famously done.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; With all his cleverness
he will be all the evening hunting for the farmhouse and the
mother that has broke her leg; so he is out of our way.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; But what need have you to want him out of
your way, now Lord John has come over to your side?&nbsp; You
have the thing at a dead beat.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Not so dead either; for there&rsquo;s a
great independent party, you know; and if <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t
help me, Bursal, to canvass them, I shall be no captain.&nbsp; It
is you I depend upon after all.&nbsp; Will you come and canvass
them with me?&nbsp; Dear Bursal, pray&mdash;all depends upon
you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Pulls him by the
arm&mdash;Bursal follows</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Well, if all depends upon me, I&rsquo;ll
see what I can do for you.&nbsp; (<i>Aside</i>.)&nbsp; Then I am
of some consequence!&nbsp; Money makes a man of some consequence,
I see; at least with some folks.</p>

<p><i>Farmer</i>.&nbsp; Why, young gentleman, I&rsquo;m glad I
happened to light upon you here, and so to hinder you from going
farther astray, and set your heart at ease like.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Thanks, good farmer, you have set my heart
at ease, indeed.&nbsp; But the truth is, they did frighten me
confoundedly&mdash;more fool I.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; No fool at all, to my notion.&nbsp; I
should, at your age, ay, or at my age, just the self-same way
have been frightened myself, if so be that mention had been made
to me, that way, of my own mother&rsquo;s having broke her leg or
so.&nbsp; And greater, by a great deal, the shame for them that
frighted you, than for you to be frighted.&nbsp; How young
gentlemen, now, can bring themselves for to tell such lies, is to
me, now, a matter of amazement, like, that I can&rsquo;t noways
get over.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Oh, farmer, such lies are very witty,
though you and I don&rsquo;t just now like the wit of them.&nbsp;
This is fun, this is quizzing; but you don&rsquo;t know what we
young gentlemen mean by quizzing.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Ay, but I do though, to my cost, ever since
last year.&nbsp; Look you, now, at yon fine field of wheat.&nbsp;
Well, it was just as fine, and finer, last year, till a young
Eton jackanapes&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Take care what you say, farmer; for I am a
young Eton jackanapes.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; No; but you be not the young Eton
jackanapes that I&rsquo;m a-thinking on.&nbsp; I tell you it was
this time last year, man; he was a-horseback, I tell ye, mounted
upon a fine bay hunter, out a-hunting, like.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; I tell you it was this time last year, man,
that I was mounted upon a fine bay hunter, out a-hunting.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Zooks! would you argufy a man out of his
wits?&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t go for to tell me that you are that
impertinent little jackanapes!</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; No! no!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not tell you that
I am an impertinent little jackanapes!</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i> (<i>wiping his forehead</i>).&nbsp; Well,
don&rsquo;t then, for I can&rsquo;t believe it; and you put me
out.&nbsp; Where was I?</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Mounted upon a fine bay hunter.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Ay, so he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,
<i>you</i>,&rdquo; says he, meaning me&mdash;&ldquo;open this
gate for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, if he had but a-spoke me fair, I
would not have gainsaid him: but he falls to swearing, so I bid
him open the gate for himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bull
behind you, farmer,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; I turns.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quizzed him!&rdquo; cries my jackanapes, and off he
gallops him, through the very thick of my corn; but he got a
fall, leaping the ditch out yonder, which pacified me, like, at
the minute.&nbsp; So I goes up to see whether he was killed; but
he was not a whit the worse for his tumble.&nbsp; So I should
ha&rsquo; fell into a passion with him then, to be sure, about my
corn; but his horse had got such a terrible sprain, I
couldn&rsquo;t say anything to him; for I was a-pitying the poor
animal.&nbsp; As fine a hunter as ever you saw!&nbsp; I am
sartain sure he could never come to good after.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; I do think, from the
description, that this was Wheeler; and I have paid for the horse
which he spoiled!&nbsp; (<i>Aloud</i>.)&nbsp; Should you know
either the man or the horse again, if you were to see them?</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Ay, that I should, to my dying day.</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; Will you come with me, then, and
you&rsquo;ll do me some guineas&rsquo; worth of service?</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Ay, that I will, with a deal of pleasure;
for you be a civil spoken young gentleman; and, besides, I
don&rsquo;t think the worse on you for being <i>frighted</i> a
little about your mother; being what I might ha&rsquo; been, at
your age, myself; for I had a mother myself once.&nbsp; So lead
on, master.</p>

know what it was my Lady Piercefield said to the father, and what
the father said to this one, and what&rsquo;s the matter at the

<p><i>Sally</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; No, indeed, ma&rsquo;am; I

<p><i>Miss B.</i>&nbsp; Disembosom my mind!&nbsp; Nonsense!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve nothing on my mind.&nbsp; Pray leave me, madam.</p>

so.&nbsp; (<i>To Sally</i>.)&nbsp; You need not wait, child, nor
look so curious.</p>
<p><i>Sally</i>.&nbsp; <i>Cur&rsquo;ous</i>!&nbsp; Indeed, miss,
if I look a little <i>cur&rsquo;ous</i>, or so (looking at her
dress), &rsquo;tis only because I was <i>frighted</i> to see you
take on, which made me forget my clean apron, when I came out;
and this apron&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Miss B.</i>&nbsp; Hush!&nbsp; Hush! child.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t tell me about clean aprons, nor run on with your

Oh, what will become of me? and the Talbots will soon know

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Lord
John</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wheeler</span>&mdash;<span

<p><i>Wheeler</i>.&nbsp; Well, but my lord&mdash;Well, but
Bursal&mdash;though my Lady Piercefield&mdash;though Miss Bursal
is come to Salt Hill, you won&rsquo;t leave us all at sixes and
sevens.&nbsp; What can we do without you?</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; You can do very well without me.</p>
<p><i>Bursal</i>.&nbsp; You can do very well without me.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>to Burs.</i>).&nbsp;
Impossible!&mdash;impossible! You know Mr. Finsbury will be here
just now, with the dresses; and we have to try them on.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; And to pay for them.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; And to settle about the procession.&nbsp;
And then, my lord, the election is to come on this evening.&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t go till that&rsquo;s over, as your lordship has
promised me your lordship&rsquo;s vote and interest.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; My vote I promised you, Mr. Wheeler; but
I said not a syllable about my <i>interest</i>.&nbsp; My friends,
perhaps, have not been offended, though I have, by Mr.
Talbot.&nbsp; I shall leave them to their own inclinations.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>whistling</i>).&nbsp; Wheugh! wheugh!
wheugh!&nbsp; Wheeler, the principal&rsquo;s nothing without the
interest.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Oh, the interest will go along with the
principal, of course; for I&rsquo;m persuaded, if my lord leaves
his friends to their inclinations, it will be the inclination of
my lord&rsquo;s friends to vote as he does, if he says nothing to
them to the contrary.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; I told you, Mr. Wheeler, that I should
leave them to themselves.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>still whistling</i>).&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll
do my best to make that father of mine send me off to
Oxford.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m fit to go&mdash;along with
Wheeler.&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;d best be my tutor,
Wheeler!&mdash;a devilish good thought.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; An excellent thought.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; And a cursed fine dust we should kick up at
Oxford, with your Montem money and all!&mdash;Money&rsquo;s
<i>the go</i> after all.&nbsp; I wish it was come to my making
you my last bow, &ldquo;ye distant spires, ye <i>antic</i>
towers!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>aside to Lord J.</i>).&nbsp; Ye <i>antic</i>
towers!&mdash;fit for Oxford, my lord!</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; Antique towers, I suppose Mr. Bursal
means.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Antique, to be sure!&mdash;I said antique,
did not I, Wheeler?</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; O, yes.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; What a mean animal is
this!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span

<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Why, now, what&rsquo;s become of Talbot, I
want to know?&nbsp; There he is not to be found anywhere in the

for him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Wheeler and Bursal wink at one
another</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; We know nothing of him.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; I have not the honour, sir, to be one of
Mr. Talbot&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; It is his own fault, and I am
sorry for it.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Faith, so am I, especially as it is
mine&mdash;fault I mean; and especially as the election is just
going to come on.</p>
<p><i>Enter a party of boys</i>, <i>who cry</i>, Finsbury&rsquo;s
come!&mdash;Finsbury&rsquo;s come with the dresses!</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Finsbury&rsquo;s come?&nbsp; Oh, let us
see the dresses, and let us try &rsquo;em on to-night.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>pushing the crowd</i>).&nbsp; On with
ye&mdash;on with ye, there!&mdash;Let&rsquo;s try &rsquo;em
on!&mdash;Try &rsquo;em on&mdash;I&rsquo;m to be colonel.</p>
<p>1<i>st</i> <i>Boy</i>.&nbsp; And I lieutenant.</p>

<p>4<i>th</i> <i>Boy</i>.&nbsp; And I oppidan.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i> <i>Boy</i>.&nbsp; Oh, what a pity I&rsquo;m in
mourning.</p>
<p><i>Several speak at once</i>.&nbsp; And we are
servitors.&nbsp; We are to be the eight servitors.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; And I am to be your Captain, I hope.&nbsp;
Come on, my Colonel.&nbsp; (<i>To Bursal</i>).&nbsp; My lord, you
are coming?</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; By-and-by&mdash;I&rsquo;ve a word in his
ear, by your <i>lave</i> and his.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Why, what the devil stops the way,
there?&mdash;Push on&mdash;on with them.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i> <i>Boy</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m marshal.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; On with you&mdash;on with you&mdash;who
cares what you are?</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>to Bursal</i>, <i>aside</i>).&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll pay Finsbury for me, you rich Jew?&nbsp; (<i>To Lord
John</i>.)&nbsp; Your lordship will remember your
lordship&rsquo;s promise.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; I do not usually forget my promises, sir;
and therefore need not to be reminded of them.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; I beg pardon&mdash;I beg ten thousand
pardons, my lord.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i> (<i>taking him by the arm</i>).&nbsp; Come on,
man, and don&rsquo;t stand begging pardon there, or I&rsquo;ll
leave you.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>to Burs.</i>) I beg pardon, Bursal&mdash;I
beg pardon, ten thousand times.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Manent</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord John</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Rory O&rsquo;Ryan</span>.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Wheugh!&mdash;Now put the case.&nbsp; If I
was going to be hanged, for the life of me I couldn&rsquo;t be
after begging so many pardons for nothing at all.&nbsp; But many
men, many minds&mdash;(<i>Hums</i>.)&nbsp; True game to the
last!&nbsp; No Wheeler for me.&nbsp; Oh, murder! I forgot, I was
nigh letting the cat out o&rsquo; the bag again.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; You had something to say to me,
sir?&nbsp; I wait till your recollection returns.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Faith, and that&rsquo;s very kind of
you; and if you had always done so, you would never have been
offended with me, my lord.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; You are mistaken, Mr. O&rsquo;Ryan, if
you think that you did or could offend me.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Mistaken was I, then, sure enough; but we
are all liable to mistakes, and should forget and forgive one
another; that&rsquo;s the way to go through.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; You will go through the world your own
way, Mr. O&rsquo;Ryan, and allow me to go through it my way.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Very fair&mdash;fair enough&mdash;then we
shan&rsquo;t cross.&nbsp; But now, to come to the point.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like to be making disagreeable retrospects, if I
could any way avoid it; nor to be going about the bush,
especially at this time o&rsquo; day; when, as Mr.
Finsbury&rsquo;s come, we&rsquo;ve not so much time to lose as we
had.&nbsp; Is there any truth, then, my lord, in the report that
is going about this hour past, that you have gone in a huff, and
given your promise there to that sneaking Wheeler to vote for him
now?</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; In answer to your question, sir, I am to
inform you that I <i>have</i> promised Mr. Wheeler to vote for
him.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; In a huff?&mdash;Ay, now, there it
is!&mdash;Well, when a man&rsquo;s <i>mad</i>, to be sure,
he&rsquo;s mad&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all that can be said about
it.&nbsp; And I know, if I had been <i>mad</i> myself, I might
have done a foolish thing as well as another.&nbsp; But now, my
lord, that you are not mad&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; I protest, sir, I cannot understand
you.&nbsp; In one word, sir, I&rsquo;m neither mad nor a
fool!&mdash;Your most obedient (<i>going</i>,
<i>angrily</i>).</p>
<p><i>Rory</i> (<i>holding him</i>).&nbsp; Take care now; you are
going mad with me again.&nbsp; But phoo! I like you the better
for being mad.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very often mad myself, and I would
not give a potato for one that had never been mad in his
life.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll not be quiet,
till he makes me knock him down.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Agh! agh! agh!&mdash;I begin to guess
whereabouts I am at last.&nbsp; <i>Mad</i>, in your country, I
take it, means fit for Bedlam; but with us in Ireland, now,
&rsquo;tis no such thing; it mean&rsquo;s nothing in life but the
being in a passion.&nbsp; Well, one comfort is, my lord, as
you&rsquo;re a bit of a scholar, we have the Latin proverb in our
favour&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Ira furor brevis est</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Anger is short madness).&nbsp; The shorter the better, I
think.&nbsp; So, my lord, to put an end to whatever of the kind
you may have felt against poor Talbot, I&rsquo;ll assure you
he&rsquo;s as innocent o&rsquo; that unfortunate song as the babe
unborn.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; It is rather late for Mr. Talbot to make
apologies to me.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; He make apologies!&nbsp; Not he,
&rsquo;faith; he&rsquo;d send me to Coventry, or, maybe, to a
worse place, did he but know I was condescending to make this bit
of explanation, unknown to him.&nbsp; But, upon my conscience,
I&rsquo;ve a regard for you both, and don&rsquo;t like to see you
go together by the ears.&nbsp; Now, look you, my lord.&nbsp; By
this book, and all the books that were ever shut and opened, he
never saw or heard of that unlucky song of mine till I came out
with it this morning.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; But you told me this morning that it was
he who wrote it.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; For that I take shame to myself, as it
turned out; but it was only a <i>white</i> lie to <i>sa</i>rve a
friend, and make him cut a dash with a new song at election
time.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve done for ever with white lies.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i> (<i>walking about as if agitated</i>).&nbsp; I
wish you had never begun with them, Mr. O&rsquo;Ryan.&nbsp; This
may be a good joke to you; but it is none to me or Talbot.&nbsp;
So Talbot never wrote a word of the song?</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Not a word or syllable, good or bad.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; And I have given my promise to vote
against him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll lose his election.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Not if you&rsquo;ll give me leave to speak
to your friends in your name.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; I have promised to leave them to
themselves; and Wheeler, I am sure, has engaged them by this
time.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Bless my body!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not stay
prating here then.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Exit Rory</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i> (<i>follows</i>).&nbsp; But what can have
become of Talbot?&nbsp; I have been too hasty for once in my
life.&nbsp; Well, I shall suffer for it more than anybody else;
for I love Talbot, since he did not make the song, of which I
hate to think.</p>

<p><i>Fins.</i>&nbsp; I give you infinite credit, Mr. Wheeler,
for this dress.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; <i>Infinite credit</i>!&nbsp; Why,
he&rsquo;ll have no objection to that&mdash;hey, Wheeler?&nbsp;
But I thought Finsbury knew you too well to give you credit for
anything.</p>
<p><i>Fins.</i>&nbsp; You are pleased to be pleasant, sir.&nbsp;
Mr. Wheeler knows, in that sense of the word, it is out of my
power to give him credit, and I&rsquo;m sure he would not ask
it.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; O, Bursal, pay him, and
I&rsquo;ll pay you to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Now, if you weren&rsquo;t to be captain
after all, Wheeler, what a pretty figure you&rsquo;d cut.&nbsp;
Ha! ha! ha!&mdash;Hey?</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i>&nbsp; Oh, I am as sure of being captain as of
being alive.&nbsp; (<i>Aside</i>.)&nbsp; Do pay for me, now,
there&rsquo;s a good, dear fellow, before <i>they</i> (<i>looking

<p><i>Fins.</i>&nbsp; Yes, my lord&mdash;yes.&nbsp; Many thanks:
and I have left your lordship&rsquo;s dress here, and
everybody&rsquo;s dress, I believe, as bespoke.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Here, Finsbury, is the money for Wheeler,
who, between you and me, is as poor as a rat.</p>
<p><i>Wheeler</i> (<i>affecting to laugh</i>).&nbsp; Well, I hope
I shall be as rich as a Jew to-morrow.&nbsp; (<i>Bursal counts

<p><i>Fins.</i>&nbsp; A thousand thanks for all favours.</p>

<p><i>Fins.</i>&nbsp; Indubitably, sir: but the misfortune
is&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;Mr. Talbot, sir, has bespoke no
dress.&nbsp; Your servant, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; So your friend Mr. Talbot could not afford

<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, here comes

<p>Whom have we here?&nbsp; What now?&nbsp; Come down, lads;
here&rsquo;s more fun.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s here, Talbot?</p>
<p><i>Talb.</i>&nbsp; An honest farmer, and a good natured
landlord, who would come here along with me to speak&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>).&nbsp; To speak the
truth&mdash;(<i>strikes his stick on the ground</i>).</p>
<p><i>Landlord</i> (<i>unbuttoning his waistcoat</i>).&nbsp; But
I am so hot&mdash;so short-winded, that (<i>panting and
puffing</i>)&mdash;that for the soul and body of me, I cannot say
what I have got for to say.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Faith, now, the more short winded a
story, the better, to my fancy.</p>
<p><i>Burs.</i>&nbsp; Wheeler, what&rsquo;s the matter, man? you
look as if your under jaw was broke.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; The matter is, young gentlemen, that there
was once upon a time a fine, bay hunter.</p>
<p><i>Wheel.</i> (<i>squeezing up to Talbot</i>,
<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t expose me, don&rsquo;t let him
tell.&nbsp; (<i>To the Farmer</i>.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pay for the
corn I spoiled.&nbsp; (<i>To the Landlord</i>.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
pay for the horse.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; I does not want to be paid for my
corn.&nbsp; The short of it is, young gentlemen, this &rsquo;un
here, in the fine thing-em-bobs (pointing to Wheeler), is a
shabby fellow; he went and spoiled Master Newington&rsquo;s best
hunter.</p>
<p><i>Land.</i> (<i>panting</i>).&nbsp; Ruinationed him!
ruinationed him!</p>
<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; But was that all the shabbiness?&nbsp; Now
I might, or any of us might, have had such an accident as
that.&nbsp; I suppose he paid the gentleman for the horse, or
will do so, in good time.</p>
<p><i>Land.</i> (<i>holding his sides</i>).&nbsp; Oh, that I had
but a little breath in this body o&rsquo; mine to speak
all&mdash;speak on, Farmer.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i> (<i>striking his stick on the floor</i>).&nbsp;
Oons, sir, when a man&rsquo;s put out, he can&rsquo;t go on with
his story.</p>
<p><i>Omnes</i>.&nbsp; Be quiet, Rory&mdash;hush!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Rory puts his finger on his
lips</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Why, sir, I was a-going to tell you the
shabbiness&mdash;why, sir, he did not pay the landlord, here, for
the horse; but he goes and says to the landlord,
here&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Talbot had your horse on the self-same day;
&rsquo;twas he did the damage; &rsquo;tis from he you must get
your money.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Mr. Talbot, here, who is another sort
of a gentleman (though he has not so fine a coat) would not see a
man at a loss, that could not afford it; and not knowing which of
&rsquo;em it was that spoiled the horse, goes, when he finds the
other would not pay a farthing, and pays all.</p>
<p><i>Rory</i> (<i>rubbing his hands</i>).&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
Talbot for ye.&nbsp; And, now, gentlemen (<i>to Wheeler and
Bursal</i>), you guess the <i>rason</i>, as I do, I suppose, why
he bespoke no dress; he had not money enough to be fine&mdash;and
honest, too.&nbsp; You are very fine, Mr. Wheeler, to do you
justice.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; Pray, Mr. O&rsquo;Ryan, let the farmer go
on; he has more to say.&nbsp; How did you find out, pray, my good
friend, that it was not Talbot who spoiled the horse!&nbsp; Speak
loud enough to be heard by everybody.</p>
<p><i>Farm.</i>&nbsp; Ay, that I will&mdash;I say (<i>very
loudly</i>) I say I saw him there (<i>pointing to Wheeler</i>)
take the jump which strained the horse; and I&rsquo;m ready to
swear to it.&nbsp; Yet he let another pay; there&rsquo;s the
shabbiness.</p>
<p>(<i>A general groan from all the lads</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
shabby Wheeler, shabby!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not vote for shabby
Wheeler!&rdquo;)</p>

<h4>SCENE IV.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Windsor
Terrace</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady Piercefield</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Talbot</span>, <span
class="smcap">Louisa</span>, <i>and a little girl of six years
old</i>, <span class="smcap">Lady Violetta</span>, <i>daughter
to</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Piercefield</span>.</p>
<p><i>Violetta</i> (<i>looking at a paper which Louisa
holds</i>).&nbsp; I like it <i>very</i> much.</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i>&nbsp; What is it that you like <i>very</i>
much, Violetta?</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i>&nbsp; You are not to know yet, mamma; it
is&mdash;I may tell her that&mdash;it is a little drawing that
Louisa is doing for me.&nbsp; Louisa, I wish you would let me
show it to mamma.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; And welcome, my dear; it is only a sketch
of &ldquo;The Little Merchants,&rdquo; a story which Violetta was
reading, and she asked me to try to draw the pictures of the
little merchants for her.&nbsp; (<i>Whilst Lady P. looks at the
drawing</i>, <i>Violetta says to Louisa</i>.)</p>
<p>But are you in earnest, Louisa, about what you were saying to
me just now,&mdash;quite in earnest?</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; Yes, in earnest,&mdash;quite in earnest,
my dear.</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i>&nbsp; And may I ask mamma, <i>now</i>?</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; If you please, my dear.</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> (<i>runs to her mother</i>).&nbsp; Stoop down
to me, mamma; I&rsquo;ve something to whisper to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Lady Piercefield stoops
down</i>; <i>Violetta throws her arms round her mother&rsquo;s
neck</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> (<i>aside to her mother</i>).&nbsp; Mamma, do
you know&mdash;you know you want a governess for me.</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i>&nbsp; Yes, if I could find a good one.</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> (<i>aloud</i>).&nbsp; Stoop again, mamma,
I&rsquo;ve more to whisper.&nbsp; (<i>Aside to her
mother</i>).&nbsp; <i>She</i> says she will be my governess, if
you please.</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i>&nbsp; <i>She</i>!&mdash;who is <i>she</i>?</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i>&nbsp; Louisa.</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i> (<i>patting Violetta&rsquo;s cheek</i>).&nbsp;
You are a little fool.&nbsp; Miss Talbot is only playing with
you.</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i>&nbsp; No, indeed, mamma; she is in earnest; are
not you, Louisa?&mdash;Oh, say yes!</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> (<i>claps her hands</i>).&nbsp; <i>Yes</i>,
mamma; do you hear <i>yes</i>?</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; If Lady Piercefield will trust you to my
care, I am persuaded that I should be much happier as your
governess, my good little Violetta, than as an humble dependent
of Miss Bursal&rsquo;s.&nbsp; (<i>Aside to her mother</i>.)&nbsp;
You see that, now I am put to the trial, I keep to my resolution,
dear mother.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. T.</i>&nbsp; Your ladyship would not be surprised at
this offer of my Louisa, if you had heard, as we have done within
these few hours, of the loss of the East India ship in which
almost our whole property was embarked.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Bombay Castle</i> is wrecked.</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i>&nbsp; The <i>Bombay Castle</i>!&nbsp; I have
the pleasure to tell you that you are misinformed&mdash;it was
the <i>Airly Castle</i> that was wrecked.</p>
<p><i>Louisa and Mrs. T.</i>&nbsp; Indeed!</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i>&nbsp; Yes; you may depend upon it&mdash;it was
the <i>Airly Castle</i> that was lost.&nbsp; You know I am just
come from Portsmouth, where I went to meet my brother, Governor
Morton, who came home with the last India fleet, and from whom I
had the intelligence.</p>
<p>(<i>Here Violetta interrupts</i>, <i>to ask her mother for her
nosegay</i>&mdash;<i>Lady P. gives it to her</i>, <i>then goes on
speaking</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i>&nbsp; They were in such haste, foolish people!
to carry their news to London, that they mistook one castle for
another.&nbsp; But do you know that Mr. Bursal loses fifty
thousand pounds, it is said, by the <i>Airly Castle</i>!&nbsp;
When I told him she was lost, I thought he would have dropped
down.&nbsp; However, I found he comforted himself afterwards with
a bottle of Burgundy: but poor Miss Bursal has been in hysterics
ever since.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. T.</i>&nbsp; Poor girl!&nbsp; My Louisa, <i>you</i>
did not fall into hysterics, when I told you of the loss of our
whole fortune.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Violetta</i>, <i>during this
dialogue</i>, <i>has been seated on the ground making up a
nosegay</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; Fall into
hysterics!&nbsp; What are hysterics, I wonder.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; Miss Bursal is much to be pitied; for the
loss of wealth will be the loss of happiness to her.</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i>&nbsp; It is to be hoped that the loss may at
least check the foolish pride and extravagance of young Bursal,
who, as my son tells me&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>A cry of</i> &ldquo;Huzza!
huzza!&rdquo; <i>behind the scenes</i>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord John</span>.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i> (<i>hastily</i>).&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye do,
mother!&nbsp; Miss Talbot, I give you joy.</p>
<p><i>Lady P.</i>&nbsp; Take breath&mdash;take breath.</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; It is my brother.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. T.</i>&nbsp; Here he is!&mdash;Hark! hark!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>A cry behind the scenes of</i>
&ldquo;Talbot and truth for ever! Huzza!&rdquo;)</p>
<p><i>Louisa</i>.&nbsp; They are chairing him.</p>
<p><i>Lord J.</i>&nbsp; Yes, they are chairing him; and he has
been chosen for his honourable conduct, not for his
electioneering skill; for, to do him justice, Coriolanus himself
was not a worse electioneerer.</p>
<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rory O&rsquo;ryan</span>

<p><i>Rory</i>.&nbsp; Easy, easy.&nbsp; Set him down?&nbsp; No
such <i>ting</i>! give him t&rsquo;other huzza!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nothing like a good loud huzza in this world.&nbsp;
Yes, there is! for, as my Lord John said just now, out of some

173</span>FORGIVE AND FORGET.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the neighbourhood of a seaport
town in the west of England, there lived a gardener, who had one
son, called Maurice, to whom he was very partial.&nbsp; One day
his father sent him to the neighbouring town to purchase some
garden seeds for him.&nbsp; When Maurice got to the seed-shop, it
was full of people, who were all impatient to be served: first a
great tall man, and next a great fat woman pushed before him; and
he stood quietly beside the counter, waiting till somebody should
be at leisure to attend to him.&nbsp; At length, when all the
other people who were in the shop had got what they wanted, the
shopman turned to Maurice&mdash;&ldquo;And what do you want, my
patient little fellow?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want all these seeds for my father,&rdquo; said
Maurice, putting a list of seeds into the shopman&rsquo;s hand;
&ldquo;and I have brought money to pay for them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seedsman looked out all the seeds that Maurice wanted, and
packed them up in paper: he was folding up some painted
lady-peas, when, from a door at the back of the shop, there came
in a square, rough-faced man, who exclaimed, the moment he came
in, &ldquo;Are the seeds I ordered ready?&mdash;The wind&rsquo;s
fair&mdash;they ought to have been aboard yesterday.&nbsp; And my
china jar, is it packed up and directed? where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is up there on the shelf over your head, sir,&rdquo;
answered the seedsman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is very safe, you see; but
we have not had time to pack it yet.&nbsp; It shall be done
to-day; and we will get the seeds ready for you, sir,
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately! then stir about it.&nbsp; The seeds will
not pack themselves up.&nbsp; Make haste, pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately, sir, as soon as I have done up the parcel
for this little boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What signifies the parcel for this little boy?&nbsp; He
can wait, and I cannot&mdash;wind and tide wait for no man.&nbsp;
Here, my good lad, take your parcel, and sheer off,&rdquo; said
the impatient man; and, as he spoke, he took up the parcel of
seeds from the counter, as the shopman stooped to look for a
sheet of thick brown paper and packthread to tie it up.</p>
<p>The parcel was but loosely folded up, and as the impatient man
lifted it, the weight of the peas which were withinside of it
burst the paper, and all the seeds fell out upon the floor,
whilst Maurice in vain held his hands to catch them.&nbsp; The
peas rolled to all parts of the shop; the impatient man swore at
them, but Maurice, without being out of humour, set about
collecting them as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Whilst the boy was busied in this manner, the man got what
seeds he wanted; and as he was talking about them, a sailor came
into the shop, and said, &ldquo;Captain, the wind has changed
within these five minutes, and it looks as if we should have ugly
weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; replied the rough
faced man, who was the captain of a ship.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad
to have a day longer to stay ashore, and I&rsquo;ve business
enough on my hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; The captain pushed forward
towards the shop door.&nbsp; Maurice, who was kneeling on the
floor, picking up his seeds, saw that the captain&rsquo;s foot
was entangled in some packthread which hung down from the shelf
on which the china jar stood.&nbsp; Maurice saw that, if the
captain took one more step forward, he must pull the string, so
that it would throw down the jar, round the bottom of which the
packthread was entangled.&nbsp; He immediately caught hold of the
captain&rsquo;s leg, and stopped him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay!&nbsp;
Stand still, sir!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or you will break your
china jar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stood still, looked, and saw how the packthread had
caught in his shoe buckle, and how it was near dragging down his
beautiful china jar.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am really very much obliged
to you, my little fellow,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
saved my jar, which I would not have broken for ten guineas, for
it is for my wife, and I&rsquo;ve brought it safe from abroad
many a league.&nbsp; It would have been a pity if I had broken it
just when it was safe landed.&nbsp; I am really much obliged to
you, my little fellow, this was returning good for evil.&nbsp; I
am sorry I threw down your seeds, as you are such a good natured,
forgiving boy.&nbsp; Be so kind,&rdquo; continued he, turning to
the shopman, &ldquo;as to reach down that china jar for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shopman lifted down the jar very carefully, and the
captain took off the cover, and pulled out some tulip
roots.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem, by the quantity of seeds you have
got, to belong to a gardener.&nbsp; Are you fond of
gardening?&rdquo; said he to Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Maurice, &ldquo;very fond of
it; for my father is a gardener, and he lets me help him at his
work, and he has given me a little garden of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here are a couple of tulip-roots for you; and if
you take care of them, I&rsquo;ll promise you that you will have
the finest tulips in England in your little garden.&nbsp; These
tulips were given to me by a Dutch merchant, who told me that
they were some of the rarest and finest in Holland.&nbsp; They
will prosper with you, I&rsquo;m sure, wind and weather
permitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice thanked the gentleman, and returned home, eager to
show his precious tulip-roots to his father, and to a companion
of his, the son of a nurseryman, who lived near him.&nbsp; Arthur
was the name of the nurseryman&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>The first thing Maurice did, after showing his tulip-roots to
his father, was to run to Arthur&rsquo;s garden in search of
him.&nbsp; Their gardens were separated only by a low wall of
loose stones: &ldquo;Arthur! Arthur! where are you?&nbsp; Are you
in your garden!&nbsp; I want you.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Arthur made no
answer, and did not, as usual, come running to meet his
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know where you are,&rdquo; continued
Maurice, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m coming to you as fast as the
raspberry-bushes will let me.&nbsp; I have good news for
you&mdash;something you&rsquo;ll be delighted to see,
Arthur!&mdash;Ha!&mdash;but here is something that I am not
delighted to see, I am sure,&rdquo; said poor Maurice, who, when
he had got through the raspberry-bushes, and had come in sight of
his own garden, beheld his bell-glass&mdash;his beloved
bell-glass, under which his cucumbers were grown so
finely&mdash;his only bell-glass, broken to pieces!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; said Arthur, who stood
leaning upon his spade in his own garden; &ldquo;I am afraid you
will be very angry with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, was it you, Arthur, broke my bell-glass!&nbsp; Oh,
how could you do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was throwing weeds and rubbish over the wall, and by
accident a great lump of couch-grass, with stones hanging to the
roots, fell upon your bell-glass, and broke it, as you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maurice lifted up the lump of couch-grass, which had fallen
through the broken glass upon his cucumbers, and he looked at his
cucumbers for a moment in silence&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my poor
cucumbers! you must all die now.&nbsp; I shall see all your
yellow flowers withered to-morrow; but it is done, and it cannot
be helped; so, Arthur, let us say no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good; I thought you would have been
angry.&nbsp; I am sure I should have been exceedingly angry if
you had broken the glass, if it had been mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forgive and forget, as my father always says;
that&rsquo;s the best way.&nbsp; Look what I have got for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he told Arthur the story of the captain of
the ship, and the china jar; the seeds having been thrown down,
and of the fine tulip-roots which had been given to him; and
Maurice concluded by offering one of the precious roots to
Arthur, who thanked him with great joy, and repeatedly said,
&ldquo;How good you were not to be angry with me for breaking
your bell-glass!&nbsp; I am much more sorry for it than if you
had been in a passion with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur now went to plant his tulip-root: and Maurice looked at
the beds which his companion had been digging, and at all the
things which were coming up in his garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is,&rdquo; said Arthur,
&ldquo;but you always seem as glad to see the things in my garden
coming up, and doing well, as if they were all your own.&nbsp; I
am much happier since my father came to live here, and since you
and I have been allowed to work and to play together, than I ever
was before; for you must know, before we came to live here, I had
a cousin in the house with me, who used to plague me.&nbsp; He
was not nearly so good-natured as you are.&nbsp; He never took
pleasure in looking at my garden, or at anything that I did that
was well done; and he never gave me a share of anything that he
had; and so I did not like him; how could I?&nbsp; But, I believe
that hating people makes us unhappy; for I know I never was happy
when I was quarrelling with him; and I am always happy with you,
Maurice.&nbsp; You know we never quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be well for all the world if they could be convinced,
like Arthur, that to live in friendship is better than to
quarrel.&nbsp; It would be well for all the world if they
followed Maurice&rsquo;s maxim of &ldquo;Forgive and
Forget,&rdquo; when they receive, or when they imagine that they
receive, an injury.</p>
<p>Arthur&rsquo;s father, Mr. Oakly, the nurseryman, was apt to
take offence at trifles; and when he thought that any of his
neighbours disobliged him, he was too proud to ask them to
explain their conduct; therefore he was often mistaken in his
judgment of them.&nbsp; He thought that it showed <i>spirit</i>,
to remember and to resent an injury; and, therefore, though he
was not an ill-natured man, he was sometimes led, by this
mistaken idea of <i>spirit</i>, to do ill-natured things:
&ldquo;A warm friend and a bitter enemy,&rdquo; was one of his
maxims, and he had many more enemies than friends.&nbsp; He was
not very rich, but he was proud; and his favourite proverb was,
&ldquo;Better live in spite than in pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When first he settled near Mr. Grant, the gardener, he felt
inclined to dislike him, because he was told that Mr. Grant was a
Scotchman, and he had a prejudice against Scotchmen; all of whom
he believed to be cunning and avaricious, because he had once
been over-reached by a Scotch peddler.&nbsp; Grant&rsquo;s
friendly manners in some degree conquered this prepossession but
still he secretly suspected that <i>this civility</i>, as he
said, &ldquo;<i>was all show</i>, <i>and that he was not</i>,
<i>nor could not</i>, <i>being a Scotchman</i>, <i>be such a
hearty friend as a true-born Englishman</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grant had some remarkably fine raspberries.&nbsp; The fruit
was so large, as to be quite a curiosity.&nbsp; When it was in
season, many strangers came from the neighbouring town, which was
a sea-bathing place, to look at these raspberries, which obtained
the name of Brobdingnag raspberries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came you, pray, neighbour Grant, if a man may ask,
by these wonderful fine raspberries?&rdquo; said Mr. Oakly, one
evening, to the gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; replied Grant, with an
arch smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, in case it&rsquo;s a secret, I&rsquo;ve no more to
say; for I never meddle with any man&rsquo;s secrets that he does
not choose to trust me with.&nbsp; But I wish, neighbour Grant,
you would put down that book.&nbsp; You are always poring over
some book or another when a man comes to see you, which is not,
according to my notions (being a plain, <i>unlarned</i>
Englishman bred and born), so civil and neighbourly as might
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Grant hastily shut his book, but remarked, with a shrewd
glance at his son, that it was in that book he found his
Brobdingnag raspberries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are pleased to be pleasant upon them that have not
the luck to be as book-<i>larned</i> as yourself, Mr. Grant; but
I take it, being only a plain spoken Englishman, as I observed
afore, that one is to the full as like to find a raspberry in
one&rsquo;s garden as in one&rsquo;s book, Mr. Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grant, observing that his neighbour spoke rather in a surly
tone, did not contradict him; being well versed in the Bible, he
knew that &ldquo;A soft word turneth away wrath,&rdquo; and he
answered, in a good humoured voice, &ldquo;I hear, neighbour
Oakly, you are likely to make a great deal of money of your
nursery this year.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s to the health of you and
yours, not forgetting the seedling larches, which I see are
coming on finely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, neighbour, kindly; the larches are coming on
tolerably well, that&rsquo;s certain; and here&rsquo;s to your
good health, Mr. Grant&mdash;you and yours, not forgetting your,
what dye call &rsquo;em
raspberries&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>drinks</i>)&mdash;and, after a
pause, resumes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not apt to be a beggar,
neighbour, but if you could give me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mr. Oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some
strangers, and he did finish making his request&mdash;Mr. Oakly
was not, as he said of himself, apt to ask favours, and nothing
but Grant&rsquo;s cordiality could have conquered his prejudices,
so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a Scotchman.&nbsp; He
was going to have asked for some of the Brobdingnag
raspberry-plants.&nbsp; The next day the thought of the
raspberry-plants recurred to his memory, but being a bashful man,
he did not like to go himself on purpose to make his request, and
he desired his wife, who was just setting out to market, to call
at Grant&rsquo;s gate, and, if he was at work in his garden, to
ask him for a few plants of his raspberries.</p>
<p>The answer which Oakly&rsquo;s wife brought to him was that
Mr. Grant had not a raspberry-plant in the world to give him, and
that if he had ever so many, he would not give one away, except
to his own son.</p>
<p>Oakly flew into a passion when he received such a message,
declared it was just such a mean, shabby trick as might have been
expected from a Scotchman&mdash;called himself a booby, a dupe,
and a blockhead, for ever having trusted to the civil speeches of
a Scotchman&mdash;swore that he would die in the parish workhouse
before he would ever ask another favour, be it ever so small,
from a Scotchman; related to his wife, for the hundredth time,
the way in which he had been taken in by the Scotch peddler ten
years ago, and concluded by forswearing all further intercourse
with Mr. Grant, and all belonging to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son Arthur,&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to the
boy, who just then came in from work&mdash;&ldquo;Son Arthur, do
you hear me? let me never again see you with Grant&rsquo;s
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Maurice, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Maurice Grant, I say; I forbid you from this day
and hour forward to have anything to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why, dear father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask no questions but do as I bid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur burst out a crying, and only said, &ldquo;Yes, father,
I&rsquo;ll do as you bid me, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why now, what does the boy cry for?&nbsp; Is there no
other boy, simpleton, think you, to play with, but this
Scotchman&rsquo;s son!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll find out another
play-fellow for ye, child, if that be all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all, father,&rdquo; said Arthur,
trying to stop himself from sobbing; &ldquo;but the thing is, I
shall never have such another play-fellow,&mdash;I shall never
have such another friend as Maurice Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like father like son&mdash;you may think yourself well
off to have done with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done with him!&nbsp; Oh, father, and shall I never go
again to work in his garden, and may not he come to
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Oakly, sturdily; &ldquo;his father
has used me uncivil, and no man shall use me uncivil twice.&nbsp;
I say no.&nbsp; Wife, sweep up this hearth.&nbsp; Boy,
don&rsquo;t take on like a fool; but eat thy bacon and greens,
and let&rsquo;s hear no more of Maurice Grant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur promised to obey his father.&nbsp; He only begged that
he might once more speak to Maurice, and tell him that it was by
his father&rsquo;s orders he acted.&nbsp; This request was
granted; but when Arthur further begged to know what reason he
might give for this separation, his father refused to tell his
reasons.&nbsp; The two friends took leave of one another very
sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant, when he heard of all this, endeavoured to discover
what could have offended his neighbour; but all explanation was
prevented by the obstinate silence of Oakly.</p>
<p>Now, the message which Grant really sent about the Brobdingnag
raspberries was somewhat different from that which Mr. Oakly
received.&nbsp; The message was, that the raspberries were not
Mr. Grant&rsquo;s; that therefore he had no right to give them
away; that they belonged to his son Maurice, and that this was
not the right time of year for planting them.&nbsp; This message
had been unluckily misunderstood.&nbsp; Grant gave his answer to
his wife; she to a Welsh servant-girl, who did not perfectly
comprehend her mistress&rsquo; broad Scotch; and she in her turn
could not make herself intelligible to Mrs. Oakly, who hated the
Welsh accent, and whose attention, when the servant-girl
delivered the message, was principally engrossed by the
management of her own horse.&nbsp; The horse, on which Mrs. Oakly
rode this day being ill-broken, would not stand still quietly at
the gate, and she was extremely impatient to receive her answer,
and to ride on to market.</p>
<p>Oakly, when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour
Grant, could not long remain without finding out fresh causes of
complaint.&nbsp; There was in Grant&rsquo;s garden a plum-tree,
which was planted close to the loose stone wall that divided the
garden from the nursery.&nbsp; The soil in which the plum tree
was planted happened not to be quite so good as that which was on
the opposite side of the wall, and the plum-tree had forced its
way through the wall, and gradually had taken possession of the
ground which it liked best.</p>
<p>Oakly thought the plum-tree, as it belonged to Mr. Grant, had
no right to make its appearance on his ground: an attorney told
him that he might oblige Grant to cut it down; but Mr. Grant
refused to cut down his plum-tree at the attorney&rsquo;s desire,
and the attorney persuaded Oakly to go to law about the business,
and the lawsuit went on for some months.</p>
<p>The attorney, at the end of this time, came to Oakly with a
demand for money to carry on his suit, assuring him that, in a
short time, it would be determined in his favour.&nbsp; Oakly
paid his attorney ten golden guineas, remarked that it was a
great sum for him to pay, and that nothing but the love of
justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of
ground, &ldquo;which, after all,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is not
worth twopence.&nbsp; The plum-tree does me little or no damage,
but I don&rsquo;t like to be imposed upon by a
Scotchman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attorney saw and took advantage of Oakly&rsquo;s prejudice
against the natives of Scotland; and he persuaded him, that to
show the <i>spirit</i> of a true-born Englishman it was
necessary, whatever it might cost him, to persist in this law
suit.</p>
<p>It was soon after this conversation with the attorney that Mr.
Oakly walked, with resolute steps, towards the plum-tree, saying
to himself, &ldquo;If it cost me a hundred pounds I will not let
this cunning Scotchman get the better of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur interrupted his father&rsquo;s reverie, by pointing to
a book and some young plants which lay upon the wall.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I fancy, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;those things are
for you, for there is a little note directed to you, in
Maurice&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp; Shall I bring it to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let me read it, child, since I must.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It contained these words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr.
Oakly</span>,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why you have quarrelled
with us; I am very sorry for it.&nbsp; But though you are angry
with me, I am not angry with you.&nbsp; I hope you will not
refuse some of my Brobdingnag raspberry-plants, which you asked
for a great while ago, when we were all good friends.&nbsp; It
was not the right time of the year to plant them, which was the
reason they were not sent to you; but it is just the right time
to plant them now; and I send you the book, in which you will
find the reason why we always put seaweed ashes about their
roots; and I have got some seaweed ashes for you.&nbsp; You will
find the ashes in the flower-pot upon the wall.&nbsp; I have
never spoken to Arthur, nor he to me, since you bid us not.&nbsp;
So, wishing your Brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as
ours, and longing to be all friends again, I am, with love to
dear Arthur and self,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your affectionate
neighbour&rsquo;s son,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Maurice Grant</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;It is now about four months since the
quarrel began, and that is a very long while.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A great part of the effect of this letter was lost upon Oakly,
because he was not very expert in reading writing, and it cost
him much trouble to spell it and put it together.&nbsp; However,
he seemed affected by it, and said, &ldquo;I believe this Maurice
loves you well enough, Arthur, and he seems a good sort of boy;
but as to the raspberries, I believe all that he says about them
is but an excuse; and, at anyrate, as I could not get &rsquo;em
when I asked for them, I&rsquo;ll not have &rsquo;em now.&nbsp;
Do you hear me, I say, Arthur?&nbsp; What are you reading
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur was reading the page that was doubled down in the book,
which Maurice had left along with the raspberry-plants upon the
wall.&nbsp; Arthur read aloud as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">(<i>Monthly
Magazine</i>, Dec. &rsquo;98, p. 421.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a sort of strawberry cultivated at Jersey,
which is almost covered with seaweed in the winter, in like
manner as many plants in England are with litter from the
stable.&nbsp; These strawberries are usually of the largeness of
a middle-sized apricot, and the flavour is particularly
grateful.&nbsp; In Jersey and Guernsey, situate scarcely one
degree farther south than Cornwall, all kinds of fruit, pulse,
and vegetables are produced in their seasons a fortnight or three
weeks sooner than in England, even on the southern shores; and
snow will scarcely remain twenty-four hours on the earth.&nbsp;
Although this may be attributed to these islands being surrounded
with a salt, and consequently a moist atmosphere, yet the ashes
(seaweed ashes) made use of as manure, may also have their
portion of influence.&rdquo; <a name="citation181"></a><a
href="#footnote181" class="citation">[181]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And here,&rdquo; continued Arthur, &ldquo;is something
written with a pencil, on a slip of paper, and it is
Maurice&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp; I will read it to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I read in this book what is said about the
strawberries growing as large as apricots, after they had been
covered over with seaweed, I thought that perhaps seaweed ashes
might be good for my father&rsquo;s raspberries; and I asked him
if he would give me leave to try them.&nbsp; He gave me leave,
and I went directly and gathered together some seaweed that had
been cast on shore; and I dried it, and burned it, and then I
manured the raspberries with it, and the year afterwards the
raspberries grew to the size that you have seen.&nbsp; Now, the
reason I tell you this is, first, that you may know how to manage
your raspberries, and next, because I remember you looked very
grave, as if you were not pleased with my father, Mr. Grant, when
he told you that the way by which he came by his Brobdingnag
raspberries was a secret.&nbsp; Perhaps this was the thing that
has made you so angry with us all; for you never have come to see
father since that evening.&nbsp; Now I have told you all I know;
and so I hope you will not be angry with us any
longer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Oakly was much pleased by this openness, and said,
&ldquo;Why now, Arthur, this is something like, this is telling
one the thing one wants to know, without fine speeches.&nbsp;
This is like an Englishman more than a Scotchman.&nbsp; Pray,
Arthur, do you know whether your friend Maurice was born in
England or in Scotland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, sir, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I never
asked&mdash;I did not think it signified.&nbsp; All I know is,
that wherever he was born, he is <i>very</i> good.&nbsp; Look,
papa, my tulip is blowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;this will
be a beautiful tulip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was given to me by Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you give him nothing for it?&rdquo; was the
father&rsquo;s inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in the world; and he gave it to me just at the
time when he had good cause to be angry with me, just when I had
broken his bell-glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a great mind to let you play together
again,&rdquo; said Arthur&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you would,&rdquo; cried Arthur, clapping his
hands, &ldquo;how happy we should be!&nbsp; Do you know, father,
I have often sat for an hour at a time up in that crab-tree,
looking at Maurice at work in his garden, and wishing that I was
at work with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Arthur was interrupted by the attorney, who came to ask
Mr. Oakly some question about the lawsuit concerning the
plum-tree.&nbsp; Oakly showed him Maurice&rsquo;s letter; and to
Arthur&rsquo;s extreme astonishment, the attorney had no sooner
read it, than he exclaimed, &ldquo;What an artful little
gentleman this is!&nbsp; I never, in the course of all my
practice, met with anything better.&nbsp; Why, this is the most
cunning letter I ever read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the cunning?&rdquo; said Oakly, and he
put on his spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good sir, don&rsquo;t you see, that all this stuff
about Brobdingnag raspberries is to ward off your suit about the
plum-tree?&nbsp; They know&mdash;that is, Mr. Grant, who is sharp
enough, knows&mdash;that he will be worsted in that suit; that he
must, in short, pay you a good round sum for damages, if it goes
on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damages!&rdquo; said Oakly, staring round him at the
plum-tree; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&nbsp; I
mean nothing but what&rsquo;s honest.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean to
ask for any good round sum; for the plum-tree has done me no
great harm by coming into my garden; but only I don&rsquo;t
choose it should come there without my leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the attorney, &ldquo;I
understand all that; but what I want to make you, Mr. Oakly,
understand, is, that this Grant and his son only want to make up
matters with you, and prevent the thing&rsquo;s coming to a fair
trial, by sending on, in this underhand sort of way, a bribe of a
few raspberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bribe!&rdquo; exclaimed Oakly, &ldquo;I never took a
bribe, and I never will&rdquo;; and, with sudden indignation, he
pulled the raspberry plants from the ground in which Arthur was
planting them; and he threw them over the wall into Grant&rsquo;s
garden.</p>
<p>Maurice had put his tulip, which was beginning to blow, in a
flower-pot, on the top of the wall, in hopes that his friend
Arthur would see it from day to day.&nbsp; Alas! he knew not in
what a dangerous situation he had placed it.&nbsp; One of his own
Brobdingnag raspberry-plants, swung by the angry arm of Oakly,
struck off the head of his precious tulip!&nbsp; Arthur, who was
full of the thought of convincing his father that the attorney
was mistaken in his judgment of poor Maurice, did not observe the
fall of the tulip.</p>
<p>The next day, when Maurice saw his raspberry-plants scattered
upon the ground, and his favourite tulip broken, he was in much
astonishment, and, for some moments, angry; but anger, with him,
never lasted long.&nbsp; He was convinced that all this must be
owing to some accident or mistake.&nbsp; He could not believe
that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on
purpose&mdash;&ldquo;And even if they did all this on purpose to
vex me,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;the best thing I can
do, is, not to let it vex me.&nbsp; Forgive and
forget.&rdquo;&nbsp; This temper of mind Maurice was more happy
in enjoying than he could have been made, without it, by the
possession of all the tulips in Holland.</p>
<p>Tulips were, at this time, things of great consequence in the
estimation of the country several miles round where Maurice and
Arthur lived.&nbsp; There was a florist&rsquo;s feast to be held
at the neighbouring town, at which a prize of a handsome set of
gardening-tools was to be given to the person who could produce
the finest flower of its kind.&nbsp; A tulip was the flower which
was thought the finest the preceding year, and consequently
numbers of people afterwards endeavoured to procure tulip-roots,
in hopes of obtaining the prize this year.&nbsp; Arthur&rsquo;s
tulip was beautiful.&nbsp; As he examined it from day to day, and
every day thought it improving, he longed to thank his friend
Maurice for it; and he often mounted into his crab-tree, to look
into Maurice&rsquo;s garden, in hopes of seeing his tulip also in
full bloom and beauty.&nbsp; He never could see it.</p>
<p>The day of the florist&rsquo;s feast arrived, and Oakly went
with his son and the fine tulip to the place of meeting.&nbsp; It
was on a spacious bowling-green.&nbsp; All the flowers of various
sorts were ranged upon a terrace at the upper end of the
bowling-green; and, amongst all this gay variety, the tulip which
Maurice had given to Arthur appeared conspicuously
beautiful.&nbsp; To the owner of this tulip the prize was
adjudged; and, as the handsome garden-tools were delivered to
Arthur, he heard a well known voice wish him joy.&nbsp; He
turned, looked about him, and saw his friend Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Maurice, where is your own tulip?&rdquo; said Mr.
Oakly; &ldquo;I thought, Arthur, you told me that he kept one for
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; said Maurice; &ldquo;but somebody (I
suppose by accident) broke it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody! who?&rdquo; cried Arthur and Mr. Oakly at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody who threw the raspberry-plants back again over
the wall,&rdquo; replied Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was me&mdash;that somebody was me,&rdquo; said
Oakly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I scorn to deny it; but I did not intend to
break your tulip, Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Maurice,&rdquo; said Arthur&mdash;&ldquo;you know
I may call him dear Maurice&mdash;now you are by, papa; here are
all the garden-tools; take them, and welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one of them,&rdquo; said Maurice, drawing back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offer them to the father&mdash;offer them to Mr.
Grant,&rdquo; whispered Oakly; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll take them,
I&rsquo;ll answer for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Oakly was mistaken: the father would not accept of the
tools.&nbsp; Mr. Oakly stood
surprised&mdash;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he to himself,
&ldquo;this cannot be such a miser as I took him for&rdquo;; and
he walked immediately up to Grant, and bluntly said to him,
&ldquo;Mr. Grant, your son has behaved very handsomely to my son;
and you seem to be glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I am,&rdquo; said Grant</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which,&rdquo; continued Oakly, &ldquo;gives me a better
opinion of you than ever I had before&mdash;I mean, than ever I
had since the day you sent me the shabby answer about those
foolish, what d&rsquo;ye call &rsquo;em, cursed
raspberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shabby answer?&rdquo; said Grant, with surprise;
and Oakly repeated exactly the message which he received; and
Grant declared that he never sent any such message.&nbsp; He
repeated exactly the answer which he really sent, and Oakly
immediately stretched out his hand to him, saying &ldquo;I
believe you: no more need be said.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only sorry I
did not ask you about this four months ago; and so I should have
done if you had not been a Scotchman.&nbsp; Till now, I never
rightly liked a Scotchman.&nbsp; We may thank this good little
fellow,&rdquo; continued he, turning to Maurice, &ldquo;for our
coming at last to a right understanding.&nbsp; There was no
holding out against his good nature.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure, from
the bottom of my heart, I&rsquo;m sorry I broke his tulip.&nbsp;
Shake hands, boys; I&rsquo;m glad to see you, Arthur, look so
happy again, and hope Mr. Grant will forgive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forgive and forget,&rdquo; said Grant and his son
at the same moment.&nbsp; And from this time forward the two
families lived in friendship with each other.</p>
<p>Oakly laughed at his own folly, in having been persuaded to go
to law about the plum-tree; and he, in process of time, so
completely conquered his early prejudice against Scotchmen, that
he and Grant became partners in business.&nbsp; Mr. Grant&rsquo;s
book-<i>larning</i> and knowledge of arithmetic he found highly
useful to him; and he, on his side, possessed a great many
active, good qualities, which became serviceable to his
partner.</p>
<p>The two boys rejoiced in this family union; and Arthur often
declared that they owed all their happiness to Maurice&rsquo;s
favourite maxim, &ldquo;Forgive and Forget.&rdquo;</p>

185</span>WASTE NOT, WANT NOT;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OR,</span><br />
TWO STRINGS TO YOUR BOW.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Gresham</span>, a Bristol merchant,
who had, by honourable industry and economy, accumulated a
considerable fortune, retired from business to a new house which
he had built upon the Downs, near Clifton.&nbsp; Mr. Gresham,
however, did not imagine that a new house alone could make him
happy.&nbsp; He did not propose to live in idleness and
extravagance; for such a life would have been equally
incompatible with his habits and his principles.&nbsp; He was
fond of children; and as he had no sons, he determined to adopt
one of his relations.&nbsp; He had two nephews, and he invited
both of them to his house, that he might have an opportunity of
judging of their dispositions, and of the habits which they had
acquired.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p185b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Waste not, want not"

"Waste not, want not"
 src="images/p185s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Hal and Benjamin, Mr. Gresham&rsquo;s nephews, were about ten
years old.&nbsp; They had been educated very differently.&nbsp;
Hal was the son of the elder branch of the family.&nbsp; His
father was a gentleman, who spent rather more than he could
afford; and Hal, from the example of the servants in his
father&rsquo;s family, with whom he had passed the first years of
his childhood, learned to waste more of everything than he
used.&nbsp; He had been told that &ldquo;gentlemen should be
above being careful and saving&rdquo;: and he had unfortunately
imbibed a notion that extravagance was the sign of a generous
disposition, and economy of an avaricious one.</p>
<p>Benjamin, on the contrary, had been taught habits of care and
foresight.&nbsp; His father had but a very small fortune, and was
anxious that his son should early learn that economy ensures
independence, and sometimes puts it in the power of those who are
not very rich to be very generous.</p>
<p>The morning after these two boys arrived at their
uncle&rsquo;s they were eager to see all the rooms in the
house.&nbsp; Mr. Gresham accompanied them, and attended to their
remarks and exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what an excellent motto!&rdquo; exclaimed Ben, when
he read the following words, which were written in large
characters over the chimney-piece, in his uncle&rsquo;s spacious
kitchen&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;WASTE NOT, WANT
NOT.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Waste not, want not!&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated his
cousin Hal, in rather a contemptuous tone; &ldquo;I think it
looks stingy to servants; and no gentleman&rsquo;s servants,
cooks especially, would like to have such a mean motto always
staring them in the face.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben, who was not so
conversant as his cousin in the ways of cooks and
gentlemen&rsquo;s servants, made no reply to these
observations.</p>
<p>Mr. Gresham was called away whilst his nephews were looking at
the other rooms in the house.&nbsp; Some time afterwards, he
heard their voices in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what are you doing
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; said Hal; &ldquo;you were called
away from us and we did not know which way to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you nothing to do?&rdquo; said Mr.
Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, nothing,&rdquo; answered Hal, in a careless
tone, like one who was well content with the state of habitual
idleness.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir, nothing!&rdquo; replied Ben, in a
voice of lamentation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, &ldquo;if you have
nothing to do, lads, will you unpack those two parcels for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two parcels were exactly alike, both of them well tied up
with good whip cord.&nbsp; Ben took his parcel to a table, and,
after breaking off the sealing wax, began carefully to examine
the knot, and then to untie it.&nbsp; Hal stood still, exactly in
the spot where the parcel was put into his hands, and tried first
at one corner, and then at another, to pull the string off by
force.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish these people wouldn&rsquo;t tie up
their parcels so tight, as if they were never to be
undone,&rdquo; cried he, as he tugged at the cord; and he pulled
the knot closer instead of loosening it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben! why, how did you get yours undone, man?
what&rsquo;s in your parcel?&mdash;I wonder what is in
mine!&nbsp; I wish I could get this string off&mdash;I must cut
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Ben, who now had undone the last
knot of his parcel, and who drew out the length of string with
exultation, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t cut it, Hal,&mdash;look what a
nice cord this is, and yours is the same: it&rsquo;s a pity to
cut it; &lsquo;<i>Waste not</i>, <i>want not</i>!&rsquo; you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Hal, &ldquo;what signifies a bit of
packthread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is whip cord,&rdquo; said Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whip cord! what signifies a bit of whip cord! you
can get a bit of whip cord twice as long as that for twopence;
and who cares for twopence!&nbsp; Not I, for one! so here it
goes,&rdquo; cried Hal, drawing out his knife; and he cut the
cord, precipitately, in sundry places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lads! have you undone the parcels for me?&rdquo; said
Mr. Gresham, opening the parlour door as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; cried Hal; and he dragged off his half
cut, half entangled string&mdash;&ldquo;here&rsquo;s the
parcel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s my parcel, uncle;
and here&rsquo;s the string,&rdquo; said Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may keep the string for your pains,&rdquo; said Mr.
Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Ben: &ldquo;what an
excellent whip cord it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Hal,&rdquo; continued Mr. Gresham, &ldquo;you
may keep your string too, if it will be of any use to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be of no use to me, thank you, sir,&rdquo; said
Hal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am afraid not, if this be it,&rdquo; said his
uncle, taking up the jagged knotted remains of Hal&rsquo;s
cord.</p>
<p>A few days after this, Mr. Gresham gave to each of his nephews
a new top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said Hal; &ldquo;these
tops have no strings; what shall we do for strings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a string that will do very well for mine,&rdquo;
said Ben; and he pulled out of his pocket the fine, long, smooth
string, which had tied up the parcel.&nbsp; With this he soon set
up his top, which spun admirably well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I wish I had but a string,&rdquo; said
Hal.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall I do for a string?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you what, I can use the string that goes round my
hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;what will you do for
a hat-band?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage to do without one,&rdquo; said Hal,
and he took the string of his hat for his top.&nbsp; It soon was
worn through, and he split his top by driving the pea too tightly
into it.&nbsp; His cousin Ben let him set up his the next day;
but Hal was not more fortunate or more careful when he meddled
with other people&rsquo;s things than when he managed his
own.&nbsp; He had scarcely played half an hour before he split
it, by driving the peg too violently.</p>
<p>Ben bore this misfortune with good humour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be helped; but
give me the string because <i>that</i> may still be of use for
something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened some time afterwards that a lady, who had been
intimately acquainted with Hal&rsquo;s mother at Bath&mdash;that
is to say, who had frequently met her at the card-table during
the winter&mdash;now arrived at Clifton.&nbsp; She was informed
by his mother that Hal was at Mr. Gresham&rsquo;s, and her sons,
who were <i>friends</i> of his, came to see him, and invited him
to spend the next day with them.</p>
<p>Hal joyfully accepted the invitation.&nbsp; He was always glad
to go out to dine, because it gave him something to do, something
to think of, or at least something to say.&nbsp; Besides this, he
had been educated to think it was a fine thing to visit fine
people; and Lady Diana Sweepstakes (for that was the name of his
mother&rsquo;s acquaintance) was a very fine lady, and her two
sons intended to be very great gentlemen.&nbsp; He was in a
prodigious hurry when these young gentlemen knocked at his
uncle&rsquo;s door the next day; but just as he got to the hall
door, little Patty called to him from the top of the stairs, and
told him that he had dropped his pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick it up, then, and bring it to me, quick,
can&rsquo;t you, child,&rdquo; cried Hal, &ldquo;for Lady
Di&rsquo;s sons are waiting for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Patty did not know anything about Lady Di&rsquo;s sons;
but as she was very good-natured, and saw that her cousin Hal
was, for some reason or other, in a desperate hurry, she ran
downstairs as fast as she possibly could towards the
landing-place, where the handkerchief lay; but, alas! before she
reached the handkerchief, she fell, rolling down a whole flight
of stairs, and when her fall was at last stopped by the
landing-place, she did not cry out, she writhed, as if she was in
great pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you hurt, my love?&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham,
who came instantly, on hearing the noise of someone falling
downstairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you hurt, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, papa,&rdquo; said the little girl, touching her
ankle, which she had decently covered with her gown.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I believe I am hurt here, but not much,&rdquo; added she,
trying to rise; &ldquo;only it hurts me when I move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry you; don&rsquo;t move then,&rdquo;
said her father, and he took her up in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shoe!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lost one of my shoes,&rdquo;
said she.</p>
<p>Ben looked for it upon the stairs, and he found it sticking in
a loop of whip cord, which was entangled round one of the
bannisters.&nbsp; When this cord was drawn forth, it appeared
that it was the very same jagged, entangled piece which Hal had
pulled off his parcel.&nbsp; He had diverted himself with running
up and downstairs, whipping the bannisters with it, as he thought
he could convert it to no better use; and, with his usual
carelessness, he at last left it hanging just where he happened
to throw it when the dinner bell rang.&nbsp; Poor little
Patty&rsquo;s ankle was terribly strained, and Hal reproached
himself for his folly, and would have reproached himself longer,
perhaps, if Lady Di Sweepstakes&rsquo; sons had not hurried him
away.</p>
<p>In the evening, Patty could not run about as she used to do;
but she sat upon the sofa, and she said, that she did not feel
the pain of her ankle <i>so much</i>, whilst Ben was so good as
to play at <i>jack straws</i> with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Ben; never be ashamed of being
good-natured to those who are younger and weaker than
yourself,&rdquo; said his uncle, smiling at seeing him produce
his whip cord, to indulge his little cousin with a game at her
favourite cat&rsquo;s cradle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall not think you
one bit less manly, because I see you playing at cat&rsquo;s
cradle with a little child of six years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal, however, was not precisely of his uncle&rsquo;s opinion:
for when he returned in the evening, and saw Ben playing with his
little cousin, he could not help smiling contemptuously, and
asked if he had been playing at cat&rsquo;s cradle all
night.&nbsp; In a heedless manner he made some inquiries after
Patty&rsquo;s sprained ankle, and then he ran on to tell all the
news he had heard at Lady Diana Sweepstakes&rsquo;&mdash;news
which he thought would make him appear a person of vast
importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, uncle&mdash;do you know, Ben,&rdquo; said
he&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s to be the most <i>famous</i> doings
that ever were heard of upon the Downs here, the first day of
next month, which will be in a fortnight, thank my stars!&nbsp; I
wish the fortnight was over; I shall think of nothing else, I
know, till that happy day comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gresham inquired why the first of September was to be so
much happier than any other day in the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Hal, &ldquo;Lady Diana Sweepstakes,
you know, is a <i>famous</i> rider, and archer, and <i>all
that</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, soberly;
&ldquo;but what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear uncle!&rdquo; cried Hal, &ldquo;but you shall
hear.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s to be a race upon the Downs on the
first of September, and after the race, there&rsquo;s to be an
archery meeting for the ladies, and Lady Diana Sweepstakes is to
be one of <i>them</i>.&nbsp; And after the ladies have done
shooting&mdash;now, Ben, comes the best part of it! we boys are
to have our turn, and Lady Di is to give a prize to the best
marksman amongst us, of a very handsome bow and arrow!&nbsp; Do
you know, I&rsquo;ve been practising already, and I&rsquo;ll show
you, to-morrow, as soon as it comes home, the <i>famous</i> bow
and arrow that Lady Diana has given me; but, perhaps,&rdquo;
added he, with a scornful laugh, &ldquo;you like a cat&rsquo;s
cradle better than a bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben made no reply to this taunt at the moment; but the next
day, when Hal&rsquo;s new bow and arrow came home, he convinced
him that he knew how to use it very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;you seem to be a
good marksman, though you have not boasted of yourself.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll give you a bow and arrow, and, perhaps, if you
practise, you may make yourself an archer before the first of
September; and, in the meantime, you will not wish the fortnight
to be over, for you will have something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; interrupted Hal, &ldquo;but if you mean
that Ben should put in for the prize, he must have a
uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why <i>must</i> he?&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, because everybody has&mdash;I mean everybody
that&rsquo;s anybody; and Lady Diana was talking about the
uniform all dinner time, and it&rsquo;s settled, all about it,
except the buttons: the young Sweepstakes are to get theirs made
first for patterns&mdash;they are to be white, faced with green,
and they&rsquo;ll look very handsome, I&rsquo;m sure; and I shall
write to mamma to-night, as Lady Diana bid me, about mine; and I
shall tell her to be sure to answer my letter, without fail, by
return of post; and then, if mamma makes no objection, which I
know she won&rsquo;t, because she never thinks much about
expense, and <i>all that</i>&mdash;then I shall bespeak my
uniform, and get it made by the same tailor that makes for Lady
Diana and the young Sweepstakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy upon us!&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, who was almost
stunned by the rapid vociferation with which this long speech
about a uniform was pronounced.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
pretend to understand these things,&rdquo; added he, with an air
of simplicity; &ldquo;but we will inquire, Ben, into the
necessity of the case; and if it is necessary&mdash;or, if you
think it necessary, that you shall have a uniform&mdash;why,
I&rsquo;ll give you one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>, uncle?&nbsp; Will you,
<i>indeed</i>?&rdquo; exclaimed Hal, with amazement painted in
his countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the last thing
in the world I should have expected!&nbsp; You are not at all the
sort of person I should have thought would care about a uniform;
and now I should have supposed you&rsquo;d have thought it
extravagant to have a coat on purpose only for one day; and
I&rsquo;m sure Lady Diana Sweepstakes thought as I do; for when I
told her of that motto over your kitchen chimney, &lsquo;<span
class="GutSmall">WASTE NOT</span>, <span class="GutSmall">WANT
NOT</span>,&rsquo; she laughed, and said that I had better not
talk to you about uniforms, and that my mother was the proper
person to write to about my uniform: but I&rsquo;ll tell Lady
Diana, uncle, how good you are, and how much she was
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care how you do that,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham:
&ldquo;for perhaps the lady was not mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, did not you say, just now, you would give poor Ben
a uniform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I would, if he thought it necessary to have
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll answer for it, he&rsquo;ll think it
necessary,&rdquo; said Hal, laughing, &ldquo;because it is
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow him, at least, to judge for himself,&rdquo; said
Mr. Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear uncle, but I assure you,&rdquo; said Hal,
earnestly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no judging about the matter,
because really, upon my word, Lady Diana said distinctly, that
her sons were to have uniforms, white faced with green, and a
green and white cockade in their hats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, still with the same
look of calm simplicity; &ldquo;put on your hats, boys, and come
with me.&nbsp; I know a gentleman whose sons are to be at this
archery meeting, and we will inquire into all the particulars
from him.&nbsp; Then, after we have seen him (it is not eleven
o&rsquo;clock yet) we shall have time enough to walk on to
Bristol, and choose the cloth for Ben&rsquo;s uniform, if it is
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell what to make of all he says,&rdquo;
whispered Hal, as he reached down his hat; &ldquo;do you think,
Ben, he means to give you this uniform, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;that he means to give
me one, if it is necessary; or, as he said, if I think it is
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that to be sure you will; won&rsquo;t you? or else
you&rsquo;ll be a great fool, I know, after all I&rsquo;ve told
you.&nbsp; How can anyone in the world know so much about the
matter as I, who have dined with Lady Diana Sweepstakes but
yesterday, and heard all about it from beginning to end?&nbsp;
And as for this gentleman that we are going to, I&rsquo;m sure,
if he knows anything about the matter, he&rsquo;ll say exactly
the same as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall hear,&rdquo; said Ben, with a degree of
composure which Hal could by no means comprehend when a uniform
was in question.</p>
<p>The gentleman upon whom Mr. Gresham called had three sons, who
were all to be at this archery meeting; and they unanimously
assured him, in the presence of Hal and Ben, that they had never
thought of buying uniforms for this grand occasion, and that,
amongst the number of their acquaintance, they knew of but three
boys whose friends intended to be at such an <i>unnecessary</i>
expense.&nbsp; Hal stood amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such are the varieties of opinion upon all the grand
affairs of life,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, looking at his
nephews.&nbsp; &ldquo;What amongst one set of people you hear
asserted to be absolutely necessary, you will hear from another
set of people is quite unnecessary.&nbsp; All that can be done,
my dear boys, in these difficult cases, is to judge for
yourselves, which opinions, and which people, are the most
reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal, who had been more accustomed to think of what was
fashionable, than of what was reasonable, without at all
considering the good sense of what his uncle said to him,
replied, with childish petulance, &ldquo;Indeed, sir, I
don&rsquo;t know what other people think; but I only know what
Lady Diana Sweepstakes said.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name of Lady Diana
Sweepstakes, Hal thought, must impress all present with respect;
he was highly astonished, when, as he looked round, he saw a
smile of contempt upon everyone&rsquo;s countenance: and he was
yet further bewildered, when he heard her spoken of as a very
silly, extravagant, ridiculous woman, whose opinion no prudent
person would ask upon any subject, and whose example was to be
shunned, instead of being imitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, my dear Hal,&rdquo; said his uncle, smiling at his
look of amazement, &ldquo;these are some of the things that young
people must learn from experience.&nbsp; All the world do not
agree in opinion about characters: you will hear the same person
admired in one company, and blamed in another; so that we must
still come round to the same point, &lsquo;<i>Judge for
yourself</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal&rsquo;s thoughts were, however, at present too full of the
uniform to allow his judgment to act with perfect
impartiality.&nbsp; As soon as their visit was over, and all the
time they walked down the hill from Prince&rsquo;s
Building&rsquo;s towards Bristol, he continued to repeat nearly
the same arguments, which he had formerly used, respecting
necessity, the uniform, and Lady Diana Sweepstakes.&nbsp; To all
this Mr. Gresham made no reply, and longer had the young
gentleman expatiated upon the subject, which had so strongly
seized upon his imagination, had not his senses been forcibly
assailed at this instant by the delicious odours and tempting
sight of certain cakes and jellies in a pastrycook&rsquo;s
shop.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, uncle,&rdquo; said he, as his uncle was
going to turn the corner to pursue the road to Bristol,
&ldquo;look at those jellies!&rdquo; pointing to a
confectioner&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must buy some of those
good things, for I have got some halfpence in my
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your having halfpence in your pocket is an excellent
reason for eating,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I really am hungry,&rdquo; said Hal; &ldquo;you
know, uncle, it is a good while since breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His uncle, who was desirous to see his nephews act without
restraint, that he might judge their characters, bid them do as
they pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then, Ben, if you&rsquo;ve any halfpence in your
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hungry,&rdquo; said Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose <i>that</i> means that you&rsquo;ve no
halfpence,&rdquo; said Hal, laughing, with the look of
superiority which he had been taught to think the <i>rich</i>
might assume towards those who were convicted either of poverty
or economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waste not, want not,&rdquo; said Ben to himself.&nbsp;
Contrary to his cousin&rsquo;s surmise, he happened to have two
pennyworth of halfpence actually in his pocket.</p>
<p>At the very moment Hal stepped into the pastrycook&rsquo;s
shop, a poor, industrious man, with a wooden leg, who usually
sweeps the dirty corner of the walk which turns at this spot to
the Wells, held his hat to Ben, who, after glancing his eye at
the petitioner&rsquo;s well worn broom, instantly produced his
twopence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I had more halfpence for you, my
good man,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve only
twopence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal came out of Mr. Millar&rsquo;s, the confectioner&rsquo;s
shop, with a hatful of cakes in his hand.&nbsp; Mr.
Millar&rsquo;s dog was sitting on the flags before the door, and
he looked up with a wistful, begging eye at Hal, who was eating a
queen cake.&nbsp; Hal, who was wasteful even in his good-nature,
threw a whole queen cake to the dog, who swallowed it for a
single mouthful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes twopence in the form of a queen cake,&rdquo;
said Mr. Gresham.</p>
<p>Hal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin;
but they thanked him, and refused to eat any, because, they said,
they were not hungry; so he ate and ate as he walked along, till
at last he stopped, and said, &ldquo;This bun tastes so bad after
the queen cakes, I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo; and he was going
to fling it from him into the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is a pity to waste that good bun; we may be glad
of it yet,&rdquo; said Ben; &ldquo;give it me rather than throw
it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you said you were not hungry,&rdquo;
said Hal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, I am not hungry now; but that is no reason why I
should never be hungry again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is the cake for you.&nbsp; Take it; for it
has made me sick, and I don&rsquo;t care what becomes of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben folded the refuse bit of his cousin&rsquo;s bun in a piece
of paper, and put it into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to be exceeding tired or sick or
something,&rdquo; said Hal; &ldquo;and as there is a stand of
coaches somewhere hereabouts, had not we better take a coach,
instead of walking all the way to Bristol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a stout archer,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, &ldquo;you
are more easily tired than one might have expected.&nbsp;
However, with all my heart, let us take a coach, for Ben asked me
to show him the cathedral yesterday; and I believe I should find
it rather too much for me to walk so far, though I am not sick
with eating good things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The cathedral</i>!&rdquo; said Hal, after he had
been seated in the coach about a quarter of an hour, and had
somewhat recovered from his sickness&mdash;&ldquo;the
cathedral!&nbsp; Why, are we only going to Bristol to see the
cathedral?&nbsp; I thought we came out to see about a
uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in
Hal&rsquo;s countenance as he pronounced these words, like one
wakening from a dream, which made both his uncle and his cousin
burst out a-laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Hal, who was now piqued,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you did say, uncle, you would go to Mr.
Hall&rsquo;s to choose the cloth for the uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, and so I will,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham;
&ldquo;but we need not make a whole morning&rsquo;s work, need
we, of looking at a piece of cloth?&nbsp; Cannot we see a uniform
and a cathedral both in one morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went first to the cathedral.&nbsp; Hal&rsquo;s head was
too full of the uniform to take any notice of the painted window,
which immediately caught Ben&rsquo;s embarrassed attention.&nbsp;
He looked at the large stained figures on the Gothic window, and
he observed their coloured shadows on the floor and walls.</p>
<p>Mr. Gresham, who perceived that he was eager on all subjects
to gain information, took this opportunity of telling him several
things about the lost art of painting on glass, Gothic arches,
etc., which Hal thought extremely tiresome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! come! we shall be late indeed,&rdquo; said Hal;
&ldquo;surely you&rsquo;ve looked long enough, Ben, at this blue
and red window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only thinking about these coloured
shadows,&rdquo; said Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can show you when we go home, Ben,&rdquo; said his
uncle, &ldquo;an entertaining paper upon such shadows.&rdquo; <a
name="citation194"></a><a href="#footnote194"
class="citation">[194]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Ben, &ldquo;did you hear that
noise?&rdquo;&nbsp; They all listened; and they heard a bird
singing in the cathedral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our old robin, sir,&rdquo; said the lad who
had opened the cathedral door for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, &ldquo;there he is,
boys&mdash;look&mdash;perched upon the organ; he often sits
there, and sings, whilst the organ is playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued the lad who showed the cathedral,
&ldquo;he has lived here these many, many winters.&nbsp; They say
he is fifteen years old; and he is so tame, poor fellow! that if
I had a bit of bread he&rsquo;d come down and feed in my
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a bit of bun here,&rdquo; cried Ben,
joyfully, producing the remains of the bun which Hal but an hour
before would have thrown away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, let us see the
poor robin eat out of your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad crumbled the bun, and called to the robin, who
fluttered and chirped, and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the
bread; but yet he did not come down from his pinnacle on the
organ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is afraid of <i>us</i>,&rdquo; said Ben; &ldquo;he
is not used to eat before strangers, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, sir,&rdquo; said the young man, with a deep
sigh, &ldquo;that is not the thing.&nbsp; He is used enough to
eat afore company.&nbsp; Time was he&rsquo;d have come down for
me before ever so many fine folks, and have eat his crumbs out of
my hand, at my first call; but, poor fellow! it&rsquo;s not his
fault now.&nbsp; He does not know me now, sir, since my accident,
because of this great black patch.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man put
his hand to his right eye, which was covered with a huge black
patch.&nbsp; Ben asked what <i>accident</i> he meant; and the lad
told him that, but a few weeks ago, he had lost the sight of his
eye by the stroke of a stone, which reached him as he was passing
under the rocks at Clifton unluckily when the workmen were
blasting.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind so much for myself,
sir,&rdquo; said the lad; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t work so well
now, as I used to do before my accident, for my old mother, who
has had a <i>stroke</i> of the palsy; and I&rsquo;ve a many
little brothers and sisters not well able yet to get their own
livelihood, though they be as willing as willing can
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does your mother live?&rdquo; said Mr.
Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard by, sir, just close to the church here: it was
<i>her</i> that always had the showing of it to strangers, till
she lost the use of her poor limbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we, may we, uncle, go that way?&nbsp; This is the
house; is not it?&rdquo; said Ben, when they went out of the
cathedral.</p>
<p>They went into the house; it was rather a hovel than a house;
but, poor as it was, it was as neat as misery could make
it.&nbsp; The old woman was sitting up in her wretched bed,
winding worsted; four meagre, ill-clothed, pale children were all
busy, some of them sticking pins in paper for the pin-maker, and
others sorting rags for the paper-maker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horrid place it is!&rdquo; said Hal, sighing;
&ldquo;I did not know there were such shocking places in the
world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve often seen terrible-looking, tumble-down
places, as we drove through the town in mamma&rsquo;s carriage;
but then I did not know who lived in them; and I never saw the
inside of any of them.&nbsp; It is very dreadful, indeed, to
think that people are forced to live in this way.&nbsp; I wish
mamma would send me some more pocket-money, that I might do
something for them.&nbsp; I had half a crown; but,&rdquo;
continued he, feeling in his pockets, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
spent the last shilling of it this morning upon those cakes that
made me sick.&nbsp; I wish I had my shilling now, I&rsquo;d give
it to <i>these poor people</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben, though he was all this time silent, was as sorry as his
talkative cousin for all these poor people.&nbsp; But there was
some difference between the sorrow of these two boys.</p>
<p>Hal, after he was again seated in the hackney-coach, and had
rattled through the busy streets of Bristol, for a few minutes
quite forgot the spectacle of misery which he had seen; and the
gay shops in Wine Street and the idea of his green and white
uniform wholly occupied his imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for our uniforms!&rdquo; cried he, as he jumped
eagerly out of the coach, when his uncle stopped at the
woollen-draper&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said Ben, stopping Mr. Gresham before he
got out of the carriage, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a uniform is
at all necessary for me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very much obliged to
you; but I would rather not have one.&nbsp; I have a very good
coat, and I think it would be waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let me get out of the carriage, and we will see
about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham; &ldquo;perhaps the sight of
the beautiful green and white cloth, and the epaulettes (have you
ever considered the epaulettes?) may tempt you to change your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Ben, laughing; &ldquo;I shall not
change my mind,&rdquo;</p>
<p>The green cloth, and the white cloth, and the epaulettes were
produced, to Hal&rsquo;s infinite satisfaction.&nbsp; His uncle
took up a pen, and calculated for a few minutes; then, showing
the back of the letter, upon which he was writing, to his
nephews, &ldquo;Cast up these sums, boys,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and tell me whether I am right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, do you do it,&rdquo; said Hal, a little
embarrassed; &ldquo;I am not quick at figures.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben
<i>was</i>, and he went over his uncle&rsquo;s calculation very
expeditiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is right, is it?&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by this calculation, I find I could, for less
than half the money your uniforms would cost, purchase for each
of you boys a warm great-coat, which you will want, I have a
notion, this winter upon the Downs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said Hal, with an alarmed look;
&ldquo;but it is not winter <i>yet</i>; it is not cold weather
<i>yet</i>.&nbsp; We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t want greatcoats
<i>yet</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember how cold we were, Hal, the day
before yesterday, in that sharp wind, when we were flying our
kite upon the Downs? and winter will come, though it is not come
yet&mdash;I am sure, I should like to have a good warm great-coat
very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed
three of them before Hal, and three before Ben.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Young gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I believe your
uniforms would come to about three guineas a piece.&nbsp; Now I
will lay out this money for you just as you please.&nbsp; Hal,
what say you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said Hal, &ldquo;a great-coat is a
good thing, to be sure; and then, after the great-coat, as you
said it would only cost half as much as the uniform, there would
be some money to spare, would not there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, about five-and-twenty
shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five-and-twenty shillings?&mdash;I could buy and do a
great many things, to be sure, with five-and-twenty shillings;
but then, <i>the thing is</i>, I must go without the uniform, if
I have the great-coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Hal, sighing, as he looked at the
epaulettes, &ldquo;uncle, if you would not be displeased, if I
choose the uniform&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be displeased at your choosing whatever you
like best,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Hal; &ldquo;I
think I had better have the uniform, because, if I have not the
uniform, now, directly, it will be of no use to me, as the
archery meeting is the week after next, you know; and, as to the
great-coat, perhaps between this time and the <i>very</i> cold
weather, which, perhaps, won&rsquo;t be till Christmas, papa will
buy a great-coat for me; and I&rsquo;ll ask mamma to give me some
pocket money to give away, and she will, perhaps.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
all this conclusive, conditional reasoning, which depended upon
the word <i>perhaps</i>, three times repeated, Mr. Gresham made
no reply; but he immediately bought the uniform for Hal, and
desired that it should be sent to Lady Diana Sweepstakes&rsquo;
son&rsquo;s tailor, to be made up.&nbsp; The measure of
Hal&rsquo;s happiness was now complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how am I to lay out the three guineas for you,
Ben?&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham; &ldquo;speak, what do you wish for
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great-coat, uncle, if you please.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Gresham bought the coat; and, after it was paid for,
five-and-twenty shillings of Ben&rsquo;s three guineas
remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next, my boy?&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrows, uncle, if you please; three arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I promised you a bow and arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, uncle, you only said a bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I meant a bow and arrows.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad
you are so exact, however.&nbsp; It is better to claim less than
more than what is promised.&nbsp; The three arrows you shall
have.&nbsp; But go on; how shall I dispose of these
five-and-twenty shillings for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In clothes, if you will be so good, uncle, for that
poor boy who has the great black patch on his eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always believed,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, shaking
hands with Ben, &ldquo;that economy and generosity were the best
friends, instead of being enemies, as some silly, extravagant
people would have us think them.&nbsp; Choose the poor, blind
boy&rsquo;s coat, my dear nephew, and pay for it.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no occasion for my praising you about the
matter.&nbsp; Your best reward is in your own mind, child; and
you want no other, or I&rsquo;m mistaken.&nbsp; Now, jump into
the coach, boys, and let&rsquo;s be off.&nbsp; We shall be late,
I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; continued he, as the coach drove on:
&ldquo;but I must let you stop, Ben, with your goods, at the poor
boy&rsquo;s door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they came to the house, Mr. Gresham opened the coach
door, and Ben jumped out with his parcel under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, stay! you must take me with you,&rdquo; said his
pleased uncle; &ldquo;I like to see people made happy, as well as
you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so do I, too,&rdquo; said Hal; &ldquo;let me come
with you.&nbsp; I almost wish my uniform was not gone to the
tailor&rsquo;s, so I do.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when he saw the look of
delight and gratitude with which the poor boy received the
clothes which Ben gave him; and when he heard the mother and
children thank him, he sighed, and said, &ldquo;Well, I hope
mamma will give me some more pocket money soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon his return home, however, the sight of the <i>famous</i>
bow and arrow, which Lady Diana Sweepstakes had sent him,
recalled to his imagination all the joys of his green and white
uniform; and he no longer wished that it had not been sent to the
tailor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand, Cousin Hal,&rdquo; said
little Patty, &ldquo;why you call this bow a <i>famous</i>
bow.&nbsp; You say <i>famous</i> very often; and I don&rsquo;t
know exactly what it means; a <i>famous</i>
uniform&mdash;<i>famous</i> doings.&nbsp; I remember you said
there are to be <i>famous</i> doings, the first of September,
upon the Downs.&nbsp; What does <i>famous</i> mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why, famous means&mdash;now, don&rsquo;t you know
what famous means?&nbsp; It means&mdash;it is a word that people
say&mdash;it is the fashion to say it&mdash;it means&mdash;it
means famous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Patty laughed, and said,
&ldquo;<i>This</i> does not explain it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hal, &ldquo;nor can it be explained: if
you don&rsquo;t understand it, that&rsquo;s not my fault.&nbsp;
Everybody but little children, I suppose, understands it; but
there&rsquo;s no explaining <i>those sort</i> of words, if you
don&rsquo;t <i>take them</i> at once.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s to be
famous doings upon the Downs, the first of September; that is
grand, fine.&nbsp; In short, what does it signify talking any
longer, Patty, about the matter?&nbsp; Give me my bow, for I must
go out upon the Downs and practise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben accompanied him with the bow and the three arrows which
his uncle had now given to him; and, every day, these two boys
went out upon the Downs and practised shooting with indefatigable
perseverance.&nbsp; Where equal pains are taken, success is
usually found to be pretty nearly equal.&nbsp; Our two archers,
by constant practice, became expert marksmen; and before the day
of trial, they were so exactly matched in point of dexterity,
that it was scarcely possible to decide which was superior.</p>
<p>The long expected lst of September at length arrived.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What sort of a day is it?&rdquo; was the first question
that was asked by Hal and Ben the moment that they wakened.&nbsp;
The sun shone bright, but there was a sharp and high wind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;I shall be glad of my good
great-coat to-day; for I&rsquo;ve a notion it will be rather cold
upon the Downs, especially when we are standing still, as we
must, whilst all the people are shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I shall feel
it cold at all,&rdquo; said Hal, as he dressed himself in his new
green and white uniform; and he viewed himself with much
complacency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning to you, uncle; how do you do?&rdquo; said
he, in a voice of exultation, when he entered the
breakfast-room.&nbsp; How do you do? seemed rather to mean,
&ldquo;How do you like me in my uniform?&rdquo;&nbsp; And his
uncle&rsquo;s cool, &ldquo;Very well, I thank you, Hal,&rdquo;
disappointed him, as it seemed only to say, &ldquo;Your uniform
makes no difference in my opinion of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even little Patty went on eating her breakfast much as usual,
and talked of the pleasure of walking with her father to the
Downs, and of all the little things which interested her; so that
Hal&rsquo;s epaulettes were not the principal object in
anyone&rsquo;s imagination but his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Patty, &ldquo;as we go up the hill
where there is so much red mud, I must take care to pick my way
nicely; and I must hold up my frock, as you desired me, and,
perhaps, you will be so good, if I am not troublesome, to lift me
over the very bad place where are no stepping-stones.&nbsp; My
ankle is entirely well, and I&rsquo;m glad of that, or else I
should not be able to walk so far as the Downs.&nbsp; How good
you were to me, Ben, when I was in pain the day I sprained my
ankle!&nbsp; You played at jack straws and at cat&rsquo;s-cradle
with me.&nbsp; Oh, that puts me in mind&mdash;here are your
gloves which I asked you that night to let me mend.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been a great while about them; but are not they not
very neatly mended, papa?&nbsp; Look at the sewing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a very good judge of sewing, my dear little
girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham, examining the work with a close
and scrupulous eye; &ldquo;but, in my opinion, here is one stitch
that is rather too long.&nbsp; The white teeth are not quite
even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa, I&rsquo;ll take out that long tooth in a
minute,&rdquo; said Patty, laughing; &ldquo;I did not think that
you would observe it so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not have you trust to my blindness,&rdquo; said
her father, stroking her head, fondly; &ldquo;I observe
everything.&nbsp; I observe, for instance, that you are a
grateful little girl, and that you are glad to be of use to those
who have been kind to you; and for this I forgive you the long
stitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s out, it&rsquo;s out, papa,&rdquo; said
Patty; &ldquo;and the next time your gloves want mending, Ben,
I&rsquo;ll mend them better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very nice, I think,&rdquo; said Ben, drawing
them on; &ldquo;and I am much obliged to you.&nbsp; I was just
wishing I had a pair of gloves to keep my fingers warm to-day,
for I never can shoot well when my hands are benumbed.&nbsp;
Look, Hal; you know how ragged these gloves were; you said they
were good for nothing but to throw away; now look, there&rsquo;s
not a hole in them,&rdquo; said he, spreading his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, is it not very extraordinary,&rdquo; said Hal to
himself, &ldquo;that they should go on so long talking about an
old pair of gloves, without saying scarcely a word about my new
uniform?&nbsp; Well, the young Sweepstakes and Lady Diana will
talk enough about it; that&rsquo;s one comfort.&nbsp; Is not it
time to think of setting out, sir?&rdquo; said Hal to his
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The company, you know, are to meet at the
Ostrich at twelve, and the race to begin at one, and Lady
Diana&rsquo;s horses, I know were ordered to be at the door at
ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stephen, the butler, here interrupted the hurrying young
gentleman in his calculations.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a poor
lad, sir, below, with a great black patch on his right eye, who
is come from Bristol, and wants to speak a word with the young
gentlemen, if you please.&nbsp; I told him they were just going
out with you; but he says he won&rsquo;t detain them more than
half a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show him up, show him up,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I suppose,&rdquo; said Hal, with a sigh,
&ldquo;that Stephen mistook, when he said the young
<i>gentlemen</i>; he only wants to see Ben, I daresay; I&rsquo;m
sure he has no reason to want to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes&mdash;Oh, Ben, he is dressed in the new
coat you gave him,&rdquo; whispered Hal, who was really a
good-natured boy, though extravagant.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much
better he looks than he did in the ragged coat!&nbsp; Ah! he
looked at you first, Ben&mdash;and well he may!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy bowed, without any cringing servility, but with an
open, decent freedom in his manner, which expressed that he had
been obliged, but that he knew his young benefactor was not
thinking of the obligation.&nbsp; He made as little distinction
as possible between his bows to the two cousins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was sent with a message, by the clerk of our
parish, to Redland chapel out on the Downs, to-day, sir,&rdquo;
said he to Mr. Gresham, &ldquo;knowing your house lay in my way,
my mother, sir, bid me call, and make bold to offer the young
gentlemen two little worsted balls that she has worked for
them,&rdquo; continued the lad, pulling out of his pocket two
worsted balls worked in green and orange-coloured stripes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are but poor things, sir, she bid me say, to look at;
but, considering she has but one hand to work with, and
<i>that</i> her left hand, you&rsquo;ll not despise &rsquo;em, we
hopes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He held the balls to Ben and Hal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are both alike, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be pleased to take &rsquo;em they&rsquo;re
better than they look, for they bound higher than your
head.&nbsp; I cut the cork round for the inside myself, which was
all I could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are nice balls, indeed: we are much obliged to
you,&rdquo; said the boys as they received them, and they proved
them immediately.&nbsp; The balls struck the floor with a
delightful sound, and rebounded higher than Mr. Gresham&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; Little Patty clapped her hands joyfully.&nbsp; But
now a thundering double rap at the door was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Master Sweepstakes, sir,&rdquo; said Stephen,
&ldquo;are come for Master Hal.&nbsp; They say that all the young
gentlemen who have archery uniforms are to walk together, in a
body, I think they say, sir; and they are to parade along the
Well Walk, they desired me to say, sir, with a drum and fife, and
so up the hill by Prince&rsquo;s Place, and all to go upon the
Downs together, to the place of meeting.&nbsp; I am not sure
I&rsquo;m right, sir; for both the young gentlemen spoke at once,
and the wind is very high at the street door; so that I could not
well make out all they said; but I believe this is the sense of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Hal, eagerly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
all right.&nbsp; I know that is just what was settled the day I
dined at Lady Diana&rsquo;s; and Lady Diana and a great party of
gentlemen are to ride&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is nothing to the purpose,&rdquo;
interrupted Mr. Gresham.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep these
Master Sweepstakes waiting.&nbsp; Decide&mdash;do you choose to
go with them or with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;uncle&mdash;sir, you know, since all the
<i>uniforms</i> agreed to go together&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off with you, then, Mr. Uniform, if you mean to
go,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham.</p>
<p>Hal ran downstairs in such a hurry that he forgot his bow and
arrows.&nbsp; Ben discovered this when he went to fetch his own;
and the lad from Bristol, who had been ordered by Mr. Gresham to
eat his breakfast before he proceeded to Redland Chapel, heard
Ben talking about his cousin&rsquo;s bow and arrows.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;he will be sorry not to
have his bow with him, because here are the green knots tied to
it, to match his cockade: and he said that the boys were all to
carry their bows, as part of the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll give me leave, sir,&rdquo; said the
poor Bristol lad, &ldquo;I shall have plenty of time; and
I&rsquo;ll run down to the Well Walk after the young gentleman,
and take him his bow and arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&nbsp; I shall be much obliged to you,&rdquo;
said Ben; and away went the boy with the bow that was ornamented
with green ribands.</p>
<p>The public walk leading to the Wells was full of
company.&nbsp; The windows of all the houses in St.
Vincent&rsquo;s Parade were crowded with well dressed ladies, who
were looking out in expectation of the archery procession.&nbsp;
Parties of gentlemen and ladies, and a motley crowd of
spectators, were seen moving backwards and forwards, under the
rocks, on the opposite side of the water.&nbsp; A barge, with
coloured streamers flying, was waiting to take up a party who
were going upon the water.&nbsp; The bargemen rested upon their
oars, and gazed with broad faces of curiosity upon the busy scene
that appeared upon the public walk.</p>
<p>The archers and archeresses were now drawn up on the flags
under the semicircular piazza just before Mrs. Yearsley&rsquo;s
library.&nbsp; A little band of children, who had been mustered
by Lady Diana Sweepstakes&rsquo; <i>spirited exertions</i>,
closed the procession.&nbsp; They were now all in
readiness.&nbsp; The drummer only waited for her ladyship&rsquo;s
signal; and the archers&rsquo; corps only waited for her
ladyship&rsquo;s word of command to march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your bow and arrows, my little man?&rdquo;
said her ladyship to Hal, as she reviewed her Lilliputian
regiment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t march, man, without your
arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal had despatched a messenger for his forgotten bow, but the
messenger returned not.&nbsp; He looked from side to side in
great distress&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s my bow coming, I
declare!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;look, I see the bow and the
ribands.&nbsp; Look now, between the trees, Charles Sweepstakes,
on the Hotwell Walk; it is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve kept us all waiting a confounded
time,&rdquo; said his impatient friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that good-natured poor fellow from Bristol, I
protest, that has brought it me; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
deserve it from him,&rdquo; said Hal, to himself, when he saw the
lad with the black patch on his eye running, quite out of breath,
towards him, with his bow and arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall back, my good friend&mdash;fall back,&rdquo; said
the military lady, as soon as he had delivered the bow to Hal;
&ldquo;I mean, stand out of the way, for your great patch cuts no
figure amongst us.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t follow so close, now, as if
you belonged to us, pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor boy had no ambition to partake the triumph; he
<i>fell back</i> as soon as he understood the meaning of the
lady&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; The drum beat, the fife played, the
archers marched, the spectators admired.&nbsp; Hal stepped
proudly, and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon
his epaulettes, or upon the facings of his uniform; whilst all
the time he was considered only as part of a show.</p>
<p>The walk appeared much shorter than usual, and he was
extremely sorry that Lady Diana, when they were half-way up the
hill leading to Prince&rsquo;s Place, mounted her horse, because
the road was dirty, and all the gentlemen and ladies who
accompanied her followed her example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can leave the children to walk, you know,&rdquo;
said she to the gentleman who helped her to mount her
horse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must call to some of them, though, and
leave orders where they are to <i>join</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She beckoned: and Hal, who was foremost, and proud to show his
alacrity, ran on to receive her ladyship&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp;
Now, as we have before observed, it was a sharp and windy day;
and though Lady Diana Sweepstakes was actually speaking to him,
and looking at him, he could not prevent his nose from wanting to
be blowed: he pulled out his handkerchief and out rolled the new
ball which had been given to him just before he left home, and
which, according to his usual careless habits, he had stuffed
into his pockets in his hurry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my new
ball!&rdquo; cried he, as he ran after it.&nbsp; As he stopped to
pick it up, he let go his hat, which he had hitherto held on with
anxious care; for the hat, though it had a fine green and white
cockade, had no band or string round it.&nbsp; The string, as we
may recollect, our wasteful hero had used in spinning his
top.&nbsp; The hat was too large for his head without this band;
a sudden gust of wind blew it off.&nbsp; Lady Diana&rsquo;s horse
started and reared.&nbsp; She was a <i>famous</i> horse woman,
and sat him to the admiration of all beholders; but there was a
puddle of red clay and water in this spot, and her
ladyship&rsquo;s uniform habit was a sufferer by the
accident.&nbsp; &ldquo;Careless brat!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;why
can&rsquo;t he keep his hat upon his head?&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
meantime, the wind blew the hat down the hill, and Hal ran after
it amidst the laughter of his kind friends, the young
Sweepstakes, and the rest of the little regiment.&nbsp; The hat
was lodged, at length, upon a bank.&nbsp; Hal pursued it: he
thought this bank was hard, but, alas! the moment he set his foot
upon it the foot sank.&nbsp; He tried to draw it back; his other
foot slipped, and he fell prostrate, in his green and white
uniform, into the treacherous bed of red mud.&nbsp; His
companions, who had halted upon the top of the hill, stood
laughing, spectators of his misfortune.</p>
<p>It happened that the poor boy with the black patch upon his
eye, who had been ordered by Lady Diana to &ldquo;fall
back&rdquo; and to &ldquo;keep at a distance,&rdquo; was now
coming up the hill; and the moment he saw our fallen hero, he
hastened to his assistance.&nbsp; He dragged poor Hal, who was a
deplorable spectacle, out of the red mud.&nbsp; The obliging
mistress of a lodging house, as soon as she understood that the
young gentleman was nephew to Mr. Gresham, to whom she had
formerly let her house, received Hal, covered as he was with
dirt.</p>
<p>The poor Bristol lad hastened to Mr. Gresham&rsquo;s for clean
stockings and shoes for Hal.&nbsp; He was unwilling to give up
his uniform: it was rubbed and rubbed, and a spot here and there
was washed out; and he kept continually
repeating,&mdash;&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s dry it will all brush
off&mdash;when it&rsquo;s dry it will all brush off, won&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; But soon the fear of being too late at the
archery meeting began to balance the dread of appearing in his
stained habiliments; and he now as anxiously repeated, whilst the
woman held the wet coat to the fire, &ldquo;Oh, I shall be too
late; indeed, I shall be too late; make haste; it will never dry;
hold it nearer&mdash;nearer to the fire.&nbsp; I shall lose my
turn to shoot; oh, give me the coat; I don&rsquo;t mind how it
is, if I can but get it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding it nearer and nearer to the fire dried it quickly, to
be sure; but it shrunk it also, so that it was no easy matter to
get the coat on again.&nbsp; However, Hal, who did not see the
red splashes, which, in spite of all these operations, were too
visible upon his shoulders, and upon the skirts of his white coat
behind, was pretty well satisfied to observe that there was not
one spot upon the facings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;will take notice of my coat behind, I daresay.&nbsp; I
think it looks as smart almost as ever!&rdquo;&mdash;and under
this persuasion our young archer resumed his bow&mdash;his bow
with green ribands, now no more!&mdash;and he pursued his way to
the Downs.</p>
<p>All his companions were far out of sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose,&rdquo; said he to his friend with the black
patch&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose my uncle and Ben had left home
before you went for the shoes and stockings for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir; the butler said they had been gone to the
Downs a matter of a good half-hour or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal trudged on as fast as he possibly could.&nbsp; When he got
upon the Downs, he saw numbers of carriages, and crowds of
people, all going towards the place of meeting at the
Ostrich.&nbsp; He pressed forwards.&nbsp; He was at first so much
afraid of being late, that he did not take notice of the mirth
his motley appearance excited in all beholders.&nbsp; At length
he reached the appointed spot.&nbsp; There was a great crowd of
people.&nbsp; In the midst he heard Lady Diana&rsquo;s loud voice
betting upon someone who was just going to shoot at the mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So then the shooting is begun, is it?&rdquo; said
Hal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, let me in! pray let me into the
circle!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m one of the archers&mdash;I am, indeed;
don&rsquo;t you see my green and white uniform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your red and white uniform, you mean,&rdquo; said the
man to whom he addressed himself; and the people, as they opened
a passage for him, could not refrain laughing at the mixture of
dirt and finery which it exhibited.&nbsp; In vain, when he got
into the midst of the formidable circle, he looked to his
friends, the young Sweepstakes, for their countenance and
support.&nbsp; They were amongst the most unmerciful of the
laughers.&nbsp; Lady Diana also seemed more to enjoy than to pity
his confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why could you not keep your hat upon your head,
man?&rdquo; said she, in her masculine tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit; but
I&rsquo;ve escaped rather better than you have.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
stand there, in the middle of the circle, or you&rsquo;ll have an
arrow in your eyes just now, I&rsquo;ve a notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal looked round in search of better friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
where&rsquo;s my uncle?&mdash;where&rsquo;s Ben?&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; He was in such confusion, that, amongst the number of
faces, he could scarcely distinguish one from another; but he
felt somebody at this moment pull his elbow, and, to his great
relief, he heard the friendly voice, and saw the good natured
face of his Cousin Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back; come behind these people,&rdquo; said Ben,
&ldquo;and put on my great-coat; here it is for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right glad was Hal to cover his disgraced uniform with the
rough great-coat which he had formerly despised.&nbsp; He pulled
the stained, drooping cockade out of his unfortunate hat; and he
was now sufficiently recovered from his vexation to give an
intelligible account of his accident to his uncle and Patty, who
anxiously inquired what had detained him so long, and what had
been the matter.&nbsp; In the midst of the history of his
disaster, he was just proving to Patty that his taking the
hatband to spin his top had nothing to do with his misfortune,
and he was at the same time endeavouring to refute his
uncle&rsquo;s opinion that the waste of the whipcord that tied
the parcel was the original cause of all his evils, when he was
summoned to try his skill with his <i>famous</i> bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hands are benumbed; I can scarcely feel,&rdquo; said
he, rubbing them, and blowing upon the ends of his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; cried young Sweepstakes,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m within one inch of the mark; who&rsquo;ll go
nearer? I shall like to see.&nbsp; Shoot away, Hal; but first
understand our laws; we settled them before you came upon the
green.&nbsp; You are to have three shots, with your own bow and
your own arrows; and nobody&rsquo;s to borrow or lend under
pretence of other&rsquo;s bows being better or worse, or under
any pretence.&nbsp; Do you hear, Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in
these laws, as he had observed that none of his companions had
such an excellent bow as he had provided for himself.&nbsp; Some
of the boys had forgotten to bring more than one arrow with them,
and by his cunning regulation that each person should shoot with
their own arrows, many had lost one or two of their shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a lucky fellow; you have your three
arrows,&rdquo; said young Sweepstakes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, we
can&rsquo;t wait whilst you rub your fingers, man&mdash;shoot
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal was rather surprised at the asperity with which his friend
spoke.&nbsp; He little knew how easily acquaintance who call
themselves friends can change when their interest comes in the
slightest degree in competition with their friendship.&nbsp;
Hurried by his impatient rival, and with his hands so much
benumbed that he could scarcely feel how to fix the arrow in the
string, he drew the bow.&nbsp; The arrow was within a quarter of
an inch of Master Sweepstakes&rsquo; mark, which was the nearest
that had yet been hit.&nbsp; Hal seized his second arrow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I have any luck&mdash;&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; But just
as he pronounced the word <i>luck</i>, and as he bent his bow,
the string broke in two, and the bow fell from his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, it&rsquo;s all over with you!&rdquo; cried
Master Sweepstakes, with a triumphant laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my bow for him, and welcome,&rdquo; said
Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir,&rdquo; said Master Sweepstakes,
&ldquo;that is not fair; that&rsquo;s against the
regulation.&nbsp; You may shoot with your own bow, if you choose
it, or you may not, just as you think proper; but you must not
lend it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now Ben&rsquo;s turn to make his trial.&nbsp; His first
arrow was not successful.&nbsp; His second was exactly as near as
Hal&rsquo;s first.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have but one more,&rdquo;
said Master Sweepstakes&mdash;&ldquo;now for it!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ben, before he ventured his last arrow, prudently examined the
string of his bow; and, as he pulled it to try its strength, it
cracked.&nbsp; Master Sweepstakes clapped his hands with loud
exultations and insulting laughter.&nbsp; But his laughter ceased
when our provident hero calmly drew from his pocket an excellent
piece of whip cord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The everlasting whip cord, I declare!&rdquo; exclaimed
Hal, when he saw that it was the very same that had tied up the
parcel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ben, as he fastened it to
his bow, &ldquo;I put it into my pocket, to-day, on purpose,
because I thought I might happen to want it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He drew
his bow the third and last time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; cried little Patty, as his arrow hit
the mark, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the nearest; is it not the
nearest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Sweepstakes, with anxiety, examined the hit.&nbsp;
There could be no doubt.&nbsp; Ben was victorious!&nbsp; The bow,
the prize bow, was now delivered to him; and Hal, as he looked at
the whip-cord exclaimed, &ldquo;How <i>lucky</i> this whip-cord
has been to you, Ben!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is <i>lucky</i>, perhaps you mean, that he took care
of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Gresham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Hal, &ldquo;very true; he might well
say, &lsquo;Waste not, want not.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a good thing
to have two strings to one&rsquo;s bow.&rdquo;</p>

(<i>settling her apron</i>).&nbsp; I came up just as I

<p><i>Just.</i>&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m very hearty
(<i>coughing</i>), always hearty, and thankful for it.&nbsp; I
hope to see many Christmas doings yet, Mrs. Bustle.&nbsp; And so
our pie is in the oven, I think you say?</p>

a wager about this old magpie and they tried him&mdash;they put a
shilling upon the table, and he ran away with it, and hid it; so
I thought that he might do so again, you know, this time.</p>
<p><i>Just.</i>&nbsp; Right, right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity,
child, you are not upon the Bench; ha! ha! ha!</p>
<p><i>Lucy</i>.&nbsp; And when I went to his old hiding place,
there it was; but you see, papa, he did not take the box.</p>
<p><i>Just.</i>&nbsp; No, no, no! because the thief was a
magpie.&nbsp; No <i>man</i> would have taken the money and left
the box.&nbsp; You see I was right; no <i>man</i> would have left
the box, hey?</p>
<p><i>Lucy</i>.&nbsp; Certainly not, I suppose; but I&rsquo;m so
very glad, old man, that you have obtained your money.</p>
<p><i>Just.</i>&nbsp; Well then, child, here&mdash;take my purse,
and add that to it.&nbsp; We were a little too hasty with the
committal&mdash;hey?</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>&nbsp; Ay, and I fear I was, too; but when one is
touched about the credit of one&rsquo;s house, one&rsquo;s apt to
speak warmly.</p>
<p><i>Old M.</i>&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m the happiest old man
alive!&nbsp; You are all convinced that I told you no lies.&nbsp;
Say no more&mdash;say no more.&nbsp; I am the happiest man!&nbsp;
Miss, you have made me the happiest man alive!&nbsp; Bless you
for it!</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>&nbsp; Well now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what.&nbsp; I
know what I think&mdash;you must keep that there magpie, and make
a show of him, and I warrant he&rsquo;ll bring you many an honest
penny; for it&rsquo;s a <i>true story</i>, and folks would like
to hear it, I hopes&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Just.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>).&nbsp; And, friend, do you hear?
you&rsquo;ll dine here to-day, you&rsquo;ll dine here.&nbsp; We
have some excellent ale.&nbsp; I will have you drink my
health&mdash;that&rsquo;s poz!&mdash;hey?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
drink my health, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;hey?</p>
<p><i>Old M.</i> (<i>bows</i>).&nbsp; Oh! and the young
lady&rsquo;s, if you please.</p>
<p><i>Just.</i>&nbsp; Ay, ay, drink her health&mdash;she deserves
it.&nbsp; Ay, drink my darling&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p><i>Land.</i>&nbsp; And please your worship, it&rsquo;s the
right time, I believe, to speak of the goose-pie now; and a
charming pie it is, and it&rsquo;s on the table.</p>
<p><i>Will.</i>&nbsp; And Mr. Smack, the curate, and Squire
Solid, and the doctor, sir, are come, and dinner is upon the
table.</p>
<p><i>Just.</i>&nbsp; Then let us say no more; but do justice
immediately to the goose-pie; and, darling, put me in mind to
tell this story after dinner.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>After they go out</i>, <i>the

<p>&ldquo;Tell this story&rdquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether
it tells well for me; but I&rsquo;ll never be positive any

MIMIC.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr</span>. and Mrs. Montague spent the
summer of the year 1795 at Clifton with their son Frederick, and
their two daughters Sophia and Marianne.&nbsp; They had taken
much care of the education of their children; nor were they ever
tempted, by any motive of personal convenience or temporary
amusement, to hazard the permanent happiness of their pupils.</p>
<p>Sensible of the extreme importance of early impressions, and
of the powerful influence of external circumstances in forming
the characters and the manners, they were now anxious that the
variety of new ideas and new objects which would strike the minds
of their children should appear in a just point of view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let children see and judge for themselves,&rdquo; is
often inconsiderately said.&nbsp; Where children see only a part
they cannot judge of the whole; and from the superficial view
which they can have in short visits and desultory conversation,
they can form only a false estimate of the objects of human
happiness, a false notion of the nature of society, and false
opinions of characters.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, Mr. and Mrs. Montague were particularly
cautious in the choice of their acquaintances, as they were well
aware that whatever passed in conversation before children became
part of their education.</p>
<p>When they came to Clifton they wished to have a house entirely
to themselves, but, as they came late in the season, almost all
the lodging houses were full, and for a few weeks they were
obliged to remain in a house where some of the apartments were
already occupied.</p>
<p>During the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard anything
of one of the families who lodged on the same floor with
them.&nbsp; An elderly quaker, and his sister Bertha, were their
silent neighbours.&nbsp; The blooming complexion of the lady had
indeed attracted the attention of the children, as they caught a
glimpse of her face when she was getting into her carriage to go
out upon the Downs.&nbsp; They could scarcely believe that she
came to the Wells on account of her health.</p>
<p>Besides her blooming complexion, the delicate white of her
garments had struck them with admiration; and they observed that
her brother carefully guarded her dress from the wheel of the
carriage, as he handed her in.&nbsp; From this circumstance, and
from the benevolent countenance of the old gentleman, they
concluded that he was very fond of his sister, and that they were
certainly very happy, except that they never spoke, and could be
seen only for a moment.</p>
<p>Not so the maiden lady who occupied the ground floor.&nbsp; On
the stairs, in the passages, at her window, she was continually
visible; and she appeared to possess the art of being present in
all these places at once.&nbsp; Her voice was eternally to be
heard, and it was not particularly melodious.&nbsp; The very
first day she met Mrs. Montague&rsquo;s children on the stairs,
she stopped to tell Marianne that she was a charming dear, and a
charming little dear; to kiss her, to inquire her name, and to
inform her that her own name was &ldquo;Mrs. Theresa
Tattle,&rdquo; a circumstance of which there was little danger of
their long remaining in ignorance; for, in the course of one
morning, at least twenty single and as many double raps at the
door were succeeded by vociferations of &ldquo;Mrs. Theresa
Tattle&rsquo;s servant!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Theresa Tattle
at home?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Theresa Tattle not at
home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No person at the Wells was oftener at home and abroad than
Mrs. Tattle.&nbsp; She had, as she deemed it, the happiness to
have a most extensive acquaintance residing at Clifton.&nbsp; She
had for years kept a register of arrivals.&nbsp; She regularly
consulted the subscriptions to the circulating libraries, and the
lists at the Ball and the Pump-rooms: so that, with a memory
unencumbered with literature, and free from all domestic cares,
she contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of
births, deaths and marriages, together with all the anecdotes,
amusing, instructive, or scandalous, which are necessary to the
conversation of a water drinking place, and essential to the
character of a &ldquo;very pleasant woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very pleasant woman,&rdquo; Mrs. Tattle was usually
called; and, conscious of her accomplishments, she was eager to
introduce herself to the acquaintance of her new neighbours;
having, with her ordinary expedition, collected from their
servants, by means of her own, all that could be known, or
rather, all that could be told about them.&nbsp; The name of
Montague, at all events, she knew was a good name, and justified
in courting the acquaintance.&nbsp; She courted it first by nods,
and becks and smiles at Marianne whenever she met her; and
Marianne, who was a very little girl, began presently to nod and
smile in return, persuaded that a lady who smiled so much, could
not be ill-natured.&nbsp; Besides, Mrs. Theresa&rsquo;s parlour
door was sometimes left more than half open, to afford a view of
a green parrot.&nbsp; Marianne sometimes passed very slowly by
this door.&nbsp; One morning it was left quite wide open, when
she stopped to say &ldquo;Pretty Poll&rdquo;; and immediately
Mrs. Tattle begged she would do her the honour to walk in and see
&ldquo;Pretty Poll,&rdquo; at the same time taking the liberty to
offer her a piece of iced plum-cake.</p>
<p>The next day Mrs. Theresa Tattle did herself the honour to
wait upon Mrs. Montague, &ldquo;to apologize for the liberty she
taken in inviting Mrs. Montague&rsquo;s charming Miss Marianne
into her apartment to see Pretty Poll, and for the still greater
liberty she had taken in offering her a piece of
plum-cake&mdash;inconsiderate creature that she was!&mdash;which
might possibly have disagreed with her, and which certainly were
liberties she never should have been induced to take, if she had
not been unaccountably bewitched by Miss Marianne&rsquo;s
striking though highly flattering resemblance to a young
gentleman (an officer) with whom she had danced, now nearly
twelve years ago, of the name of Montague, a most respectable
young man, and of a most respectable family, with which, in a
remote degree, she might presume to say, she herself was someway
connected, having the honour to be nearly related to the Joneses
of Merionethshire, who were cousins to the Mainwarings of
Bedfordshire, who married into the family of the Griffiths, the
eldest branch of which, she understood, had the honour to be
cousin-german to Mr. Montague; on which account she had been
impatient to pay a visit, so likely to be productive of most
agreeable consequences, by the acquisition of an acquaintance
whose society must do her infinite honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus happily accomplished her first visit, there seemed
little probability of escaping Mrs. Tattle&rsquo;s further
acquaintance.&nbsp; In the course of the first week she only
hinted to Mr. Montague that &ldquo;some people thought his system
of education rather odd; that she should be obliged to him if he
would, some time or other, when he had nothing else to do, just
sit down and make her understand his notions, that she might have
something to say to her acquaintance, as she always wished to
have when she heard any friend attacked, or any friend&rsquo;s
opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Montague declining to sit down and make this lady
understand a system of education only to give her something to
say, and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks
with which he was threatened, Mrs. Tattle next addressed herself
to Mrs. Montague, prophesying, in a most serious whisper,
&ldquo;that the charming Miss Marianne would shortly and
inevitably grow quite crooked, if she were not immediately
provided with a back-board, a French dancing-master, and a pair
of stocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This alarming whisper could not, however, have a permanent
effect upon Mrs. Montague&rsquo;s understanding, because three
days afterwards Mrs. Theresa, upon the most anxious inspection,
entirely mistook the just and natural proportions of the hip and
shoulder.</p>
<p>This danger vanishing, Mrs. Tattle presently, with a rueful
length of face, and formal preface, &ldquo;hesitated to assure
Mrs. Montague, that she was greatly distressed about her daughter
Sophy; that she was convinced her lungs were affected; and that
she certainly ought to drink the waters morning and evening; and
above all things, must keep one of the patirosa lozenges
constantly in her mouth, and directly consult Dr. Cardamum, the
best physician in the world, and the person she would send for
herself upon her death-bed; because, to her certain knowledge, he
had recovered a young lady, a relation of her own, after she had
lost one whole <i>globe</i> <a name="citation222"></a><a
href="#footnote222" class="citation">[222]</a> of her
lungs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The medical opinion of a lady of so much anatomical precision
could not have much weight.&nbsp; Neither was this universal
adviser more successful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to
Frederick, who, she apprehended, must want some one to perfect
him in the Latin and Greek, and dead languages, of which, she
observed, it would be impertinent for a woman to talk; only she
might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good
authority, that a competency of the dead tongues could be had
nowhere but at a public school, or else from a private tutor who
had been abroad (after the advantage of a classical education,
finished in one of the universities) with a good family; without
which introduction it was idle to think of reaping solid
advantages from any continental tour; all which requisites, from
personal knowledge, she could aver to be concentrated in the
gentleman she had the honour to recommend, as having been tutor
to a young nobleman, who had now no further occasion for him,
having, unfortunately for himself and his family, been killed in
an untimely duel.</p>
<p>All Mrs. Theresa Tattle&rsquo;s suggestions being lost upon
these stoical parents, her powers were next tried upon the
children, and her success soon became apparent.&nbsp; On Sophy,
indeed, she could not make any impression, though she had
expended on her some of her finest strokes of flattery.&nbsp;
Sophy, though very desirous of the approbation of her friends,
was not very desirous of winning the favour of strangers.&nbsp;
She was about thirteen&mdash;that dangerous age at which ill
educated girls, in their anxiety to display their
accomplishments, are apt to become dependent for applause upon
the praise of every idle visitor; when the habits not being
formed, and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and
manners, girls are apt to affect and imitate, indiscriminately,
everything that they conceive to be agreeable.</p>
<p>Sophy, whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with
her powers of reasoning, was not liable to fall into these
errors.&nbsp; She found that she could please those whom she
wished to please, without affecting to be anything but what she
really was; and her friends listened to what she said, though she
never repeated the sentiments, or adopted the phrases, which she
might easily have copied from the conversation of those who were
older or more fashionable than herself.</p>
<p>This word <i>fashionable</i>, Mrs. Theresa Tattle knew, had
usually a great effect, even at thirteen; but she had not
observed that it had much power upon Sophy; nor were her remarks
concerning grace and manners much attended to.&nbsp; Her mother
had taught Sophy that it was best to let herself alone, and not
to distort either her person or her mind in acquiring grimace,
which nothing but the fashion of the moment can support, and
which is always detected and despised by people of real good
sense and politeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tattle, to herself,
&ldquo;if I had such a tall daughter, and so unformed, before my
eyes from morning to night, it would certainly break my poor
heart.&nbsp; Thank heaven, I am not a mother! if I were, Miss
Marianne for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Marianne had heard so often from Mrs. Tattle that she was
very charming, that she could not help believing it; and from
being a very pleasing, unaffected little girl, she in a short
time grew so conceited, that she could neither speak, look, nor
be silent without imagining that everybody was, or ought to be,
looking at her; and when Mrs. Theresa saw that Mrs. Montague
looked very grave upon these occasions, she, to repair the ill
she had done, would say, after praising Marianne&rsquo;s hair or
her eyes, &ldquo;Oh, but little ladies should never think about
their beauty, you know.&nbsp; Nobody loves anybody for being
handsome, but for being good.&rdquo;&nbsp; People must think
children are very silly, or else they can never have reflected
upon the nature of belief in their own minds, if they imagine
that children will believe the words that are said to them, by
way of moral, when the countenance, manner, and every concomitant
circumstance tell them a different tale.&nbsp; Children are
excellent physiognomists&mdash;they quickly learn the universal
language of looks; and what is said <i>of</i> them always makes a
greater impression than what is said <i>to</i> them, a truth of
which those prudent people surely cannot be aware who comfort
themselves, and apologize to parents, by saying, &ldquo;Oh, but I
would not say so and so to the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Theresa had seldom said to Frederick Montague,
&ldquo;that he had a vast deal of drollery, and was a most
incomparable mimic;&rdquo; but she had said so of him in
whispers, which magnified the sound to his imagination, if not to
his ear.&nbsp; He was a boy of much vivacity, and had
considerable abilities; but his appetite for vulgar praise had
not yet been surfeited.&nbsp; Even Mrs. Theresa Tattle&rsquo;s
flattery pleased him, and he exerted himself for her
entertainment so much that he became quite a buffoon.&nbsp;
Instead of observing characters and manners, that he might judge
of them, and form his own, he now watched every person he saw,
that he might detect some foible, or catch some singularity in
their gesture or pronunciation, which he might successfully
mimic.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the rapid progress of these evils, Mr. and Mrs.
Montague, who, from the first day that they had been honoured
with Mrs. Tattle&rsquo;s visit, had begun to look out for new
lodgings, were now extremely impatient to decamp.&nbsp; They were
not people who, from the weak fear of offending a silly
acquaintance, would hazard the happiness of their family.&nbsp;
They had heard of a house in the country which was likely to suit
them, and they determined to go directly to look at it.&nbsp; As
they were to be absent all day, they foresaw that their officious
neighbour would probably interfere with their children.&nbsp;
They did not choose to exact any promise from them which they
might be tempted to break, and therefore they only said at
parting, &ldquo;If Mrs. Theresa Tattle should ask you to come to
her, do as you think proper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had Mrs. Montague&rsquo;s carriage got out of hearing
when a note was brought, directed to &ldquo;Frederick Montague,
Junior, Esq.,&rdquo; which he immediately opened, and read as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Theresa Tattle presents her very best
compliments to the entertaining Mr. Frederick Montague; she hopes
he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening, and
bring his charming sister, Miss Marianne, with him, as Mrs.
Theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache, and is
sensible her nerves are affected; and Dr. Cardamum says that
(especially in Mrs. T. T.&rsquo;s case) it is downright death to
nervous patients to be alone an instant.&nbsp; She therefore
trusts Mr. Frederick will not refuse to come and make her
laugh.&nbsp; Mrs. Theresa has taken care to provide a few
macaroons for her little favourite, who said she was particularly
fond of them the other day.&nbsp; Mrs. Theresa hopes they will
all come at six, or before, not forgetting Miss Sophy, if she
will condescend to be of the party.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the first reading of this note, &ldquo;the
entertaining&rdquo; Mr. Frederick, and the &ldquo;charming&rdquo;
Miss Marianne laughed heartily, and looked at Sophy, as if they
were afraid that she should think it possible they could like
such gross flattery; but upon a second perusal, Marianne observed
that it certainly was very good-natured of Mrs. Theresa to
remember the macaroons; and Frederick allowed that it was wrong
to laugh at the poor woman because she had the headache.&nbsp;
Then twisting the note in his fingers, he appealed to
Sophy:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sophy, leave off drawing for an instant,&rdquo;
said Frederick, &ldquo;and tell us what answer can we
send?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can!&mdash;we can send what answer we
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that,&rdquo; said Frederick.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
would refuse if I could; but we ought not to do anything rude,
should we?&nbsp; So I think we might as well go, because we could
not refuse, if we would, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made such confusion,&rdquo; replied Sophy,
&ldquo;between &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t&rsquo; and
&lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo; and &lsquo;shouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo;
that I can&rsquo;t understand you; surely they are all different
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different! no,&rdquo; cried
Frederick&mdash;&ldquo;could, would, should, might, and ought,
are all the same thing in the Latin grammar; all of &rsquo;em
signs of the potential mood, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy, whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded,
even by quotations from the Latin grammar, looked up soberly from
her drawing, and answered &ldquo;that very likely those words
might be signs of the same thing in the Latin grammar, but she
believed that they meant perfectly different things in real
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just as people please,&rdquo; said her
sophistical brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know words mean nothing in
themselves.&nbsp; If I choose to call my hat my cadwallader, you
would understand me just as well, after I had once explained it
to you, that by cadwallader I meant this black thing that I put
upon my head; cadwallader and hat would then be just the same
thing to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why have two words for the same thing?&rdquo; said
Sophy; &ldquo;and what has this to do with &lsquo;could&rsquo;
and &lsquo;should&rsquo;?&nbsp; You wanted to
prove&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to prove,&rdquo; interrupted Frederick,
&ldquo;that it&rsquo;s not worth while to dispute for two hours
about two words.&nbsp; Do keep to the point, Sophy, and
don&rsquo;t dispute with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not disputing, I was reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, reasoning or disputing.&nbsp; Women have no
business to do either; for, how should they know how to chop
logic like men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this contemptuous sarcasm upon her sex, Sophy&rsquo;s
colour rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Frederick, exulting, &ldquo;now we
shall see a philosopheress in a passion; I&rsquo;d give sixpence,
half-price, for a harlequin entertainment, to see Sophy in a
passion.&nbsp; Now, Marianne, look at her brush dabbing so fast
in the water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sophy, who could not easily bear to be laughed at, with some
little indignation, said, &ldquo;Brother, I
wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; cried Frederick, pointing to the
colour which rose in her cheeks almost to her
temples&mdash;&ldquo;rising! rising! rising! look at the
thermometer! blood heat! blood! fever heat! boiling water
heat!&nbsp; Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Sophy, smiling, &ldquo;you should
stand a little farther off, both of you.&nbsp; Leave the
thermometer to itself a little while.&nbsp; Give it time to
cool.&nbsp; It will come down to &lsquo;temperate&rsquo; by the
time you look again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, brother!&rdquo; cried Marianne, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
so good-humoured, don&rsquo;t tease her any more, and don&rsquo;t
draw heads upon her paper, and don&rsquo;t stretch her
india-rubber, and don&rsquo;t let us dirty any more of her
brushes.&nbsp; See! the sides of her tumbler are all manner of
colours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I only mixed red, blue, green and yellow, to show
you, Marianne, that all colours mixed together make white.&nbsp;
But she is temperate now, and I won&rsquo;t plague her; she shall
chop logic, if she likes it, though she is a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not fair, brother,&rdquo; said
Marianne, &ldquo;to say &lsquo;woman&rsquo; in that way.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure Sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot,
which papa showed us yesterday, long before you did, though you
are a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long,&rdquo; said Frederick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,
that was only a conjuring trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very ingenious, though,&rdquo; said Marianne;
&ldquo;and papa said so.&nbsp; Besides, she understood the
&lsquo;Rule of Three,&rsquo; which was no conjuring trick, better
than you did, though she is a woman; and she can reason, too,
mamma says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, let her reason away,&rdquo; said the
provoking wit.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I have to say is, that
she&rsquo;ll never be able to make a pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, pray, brother?&rdquo; inquired Sophy, looking
up again, very gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you know papa himself, the other day at dinner,
said that the woman who talks Greek and Latin as well as I do, is
a fool after all; and that she had better have learned something
useful; and Mrs. Tattle said, she&rsquo;d answer for it she did
not know how to make a pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! but I am not talking Greek and Latin, am
I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you are drawing, and that&rsquo;s the same
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same thing!&nbsp; Oh, Frederick!&rdquo; said little
Marianne, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may laugh; but I say it is the same sort of
thing.&nbsp; Women who are always drawing and reasoning, never
know how to make puddings.&nbsp; Mrs. Theresa Tattle said so,
when I showed her Sophy&rsquo;s beautiful drawing
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Theresa Tattle might say so,&rdquo; replied Sophy,
calmly; &ldquo;but I do not perceive the reason, brother, why
drawing should prevent me from learning how to make a
pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I say you&rsquo;ll never learn how to make a good
pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned,&rdquo; continued Sophy, who was mixing
her colours, &ldquo;to mix such and such colours together to make
the colour that I want; and why should I not be able to learn to
mix flour and butter, and sugar and egg, together, to produce the
taste that I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but mixing will never do, unless you know the
quantities, like a cook; and you would never learn the right
quantities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did the cook learn them?&nbsp; Cannot I learn them
as she did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you&rsquo;d never do it exactly, and mind the
spoonfuls right, by the recipe, like a cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! indeed! but she would,&rdquo; cried Marianne,
eagerly: &ldquo;and a great deal more exactly, for mamma has
taught her to weigh and measure things very carefully: and when I
was ill she always weighed the bark in nicely, and dropped my
drops so carefully: better than the cook.&nbsp; When mamma took
me down to see the cook make a cake once, I saw her spoonfuls,
and her ounces, and her handfuls: she dashed and splashed without
minding exactness or the recipe, or anything.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure Sophy would make a much better pudding, if exactness only
were wanting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, granting that she could make the best pudding in
the whole world, what does that signify?&nbsp; I say she never
would: so it comes to the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never would! how can you tell that, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, now look at her, with her books, and her drawings,
and all this apparatus.&nbsp; Do you think she would ever jump
up, with all her nicety, too, and put by all these things, to go
down into the greasy kitchen, and plump up to the elbows in suet,
like a cook, for a plum-pudding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not plump up to the elbows, brother,&rdquo; said
Sophy, smiling: &ldquo;nor is it necessary that I should be a
cook: but, if it were necessary, I hope I should be able to make
a pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried Marianne, warmly; &ldquo;and she
would jump up, and put by all her things in a minute if it were
necessary, and run down stairs and up again like lightning, or do
anything that was ever so disagreeable to her, even about the
suet, with all her nicety, brother, I assure you, as she used to
do anything, everything for me, when I was ill last winter.&nbsp;
Oh, brother, she can do anything; and she could make the best
plum-pudding in the whole world, I&rsquo;m sure, in a minute, if
it were necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">knock</span> at the door, from Mrs.
Theresa Tattle&rsquo;s servant, recalled Marianne to the business
of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Frederick, &ldquo;we have sent no
answer all this time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s necessary to think of that
in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant came with his mistress&rsquo; compliments, to let
the young ladies and Mr. Frederick know that she was waiting tea
for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting! then we must go,&rdquo; said Frederick.</p>
<p>The servant opened the door wider, to let him pass, and
Marianne thought she must follow her brother: so they went
downstairs together, while Sophy gave her own message to the
servant, and quietly stayed at her usual occupations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tattle was seated at her tea-table, with a large plate of
macaroons beside her when Frederick and Marianne entered.&nbsp;
She was &ldquo;delighted&rdquo; they were come, and
&ldquo;grieved&rdquo; not to see Miss Sophy along with
them.&nbsp; Marianne coloured a little; for though she had
precipitately followed her brother, and though he had quieted her
conscience for a moment by saying &ldquo;You know papa and mamma
told us to do what we thought best,&rdquo; yet she did not feel
quite pleased with herself: and it was not till after Mrs.
Theresa had exhausted all her compliments, and half her
macaroons, that she could restore her spirits to their usual
height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mr. Frederick,&rdquo; said she after tea,
&ldquo;you promised to make me laugh; and nobody can make me
laugh so well as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, brother,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;show Mrs.
Theresa Dr. Carbuncle eating his dinner; and I&rsquo;ll be Mrs.
Carbuncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Marianne</i>.&nbsp; Now, my dear, what shall I help you
to?</p>
<p><i>Frederick</i>. &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; she never calls him
my dear, you know, but always Doctor.</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; Well then, doctor, what will you eat
to-day?</p>
<p><i>Fred.</i>&nbsp; Eat, madam! eat! nothing! nothing!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see anything here I can eat, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s eels, sir; let me help you to
some eel&mdash;stewed eel;&mdash;you used to be fond of stewed
eel.</p>
<p><i>Fred.</i>&nbsp; Used, ma&rsquo;am, used!&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m sick of stewed eels.&nbsp; You would tire one of
anything.&nbsp; Am I to see nothing but eels?&nbsp; And
what&rsquo;s this at the bottom?</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; Mutton, doctor, roast mutton; if
you&rsquo;ll be so good as to cut it.</p>
<p><i>Fred.</i>&nbsp; Cut it, ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
cut it, I say; it&rsquo;s as hard as a deal board.&nbsp; You
might as well tell me to cut the table, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
Mutton, indeed! not a bit of fat.&nbsp; Roast mutton, indeed! not
a drop of gravy.&nbsp; Mutton, truly! quite a cinder.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll have none of it.&nbsp; Here, take it away; take it
downstairs to the cook.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a very hard case, Mrs.
Carbuncle, that I can never have a bit of anything that I can eat
at my own table, Mrs. Carbuncle, since I was married,
ma&rsquo;am, I that am the easiest man in the whole world to
please about my dinner.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really very
extraordinary, Mrs. Carbuncle!&nbsp; What have you at that corner
there, under the cover?</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; Patties, sir; oyster patties.</p>
<p><i>Fred.</i>&nbsp; Patties, ma&rsquo;am! kickshaws!&nbsp; I
hate kickshaws.&nbsp; Not worth putting under a cover,
ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; And why not have glass covers, that one may
see one&rsquo;s dinner before one, before it grows cold with
asking questions, Mrs. Carbuncle, and lifting up covers?&nbsp;
But nobody has any sense: and I see no water plates anywhere,
lately.</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; Do, pray, doctor, let me help you to a bit
of chicken before it gets cold, my dear.</p>
<p><i>Fred.</i> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo;
again, Marianne!</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; Yes, brother, because she is frightened, you
know, and Mrs. Carbuncle always says &ldquo;my dear&rdquo; to him
when she&rsquo;s frightened, and looks so pale from side to side;
and sometimes she cries before dinner&rsquo;s done, and then all
the company are quite silent, and don&rsquo;t know what to
do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, such a little creature; to have so much sense,
too!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Theresa, with rapture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Frederick, you&rsquo;ll make me die with
laughing!&nbsp; Pray go on, Dr. Carbuncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred.&nbsp; Well, ma&rsquo;am, then if I must eat something,
send me a bit of fowl; a leg and wing, the liver wing, and a bit
of the breast, oyster sauce, and a slice of that ham, if you
please, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(<i>Dr. Carbuncle eats
voraciously</i>, <i>with his head down to his plate</i>,
<i>and</i>, <i>dropping the sauce</i>, <i>he buttons up his coat
tight across the breast</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Fred.</i>&nbsp; Here; a plate, knife and fork, bit o&rsquo;
bread, a glass of Dorchester ale!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, admirable!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Tattle, clapping
her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, brother, suppose that it is after dinner,&rdquo;
said Marianne; &ldquo;and show us how the doctor goes to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick threw himself back in an arm-chair, leaning his head
back, with his mouth open, snoring; nodded from time to time,
crossed and uncrossed his legs, tried to awake himself by
twitching his wig, settling his collar, blowing his nose and
rapping on the lid of his snuff-box.</p>
<p>All which infinitely diverted Mrs. Tattle, who, when she could
stop herself from laughing, declared &ldquo;It made her sigh,
too, to think of the life poor Mrs. Carbuncle led with that man,
and all for nothing, too; for her jointure was nothing, next to
nothing, though a great thing, to be sure, her friends thought
for her, when she was only Sally Ridgeway before she was
married.&nbsp; Such a wife as she makes,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Theresa, lifting up her hands and eyes to heaven, &ldquo;and so
much as she has gone through, the brute ought to be ashamed of
himself if he does not leave her something extraordinary in his
will; for turn it which way she will, she can never keep a
carriage, or live like anybody else, on her jointure, after all,
she tells me, poor soul!&nbsp; A sad prospect, after her
husband&rsquo;s death, to look forward to, instead of being
comfortable, as her friends expected; and she, poor young thing!
knowing no better when they married her!&nbsp; People should look
into these things, beforehand, or never marry at all, I say, Miss
Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Marianne, who did not clearly comprehend this affair of
the jointure, or the reason why Mrs. Carbuncle would be so
unhappy after her husband&rsquo;s death, turned to Frederick, who
was at that instant studying Mrs. Theresa as a future character
to mimic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Marianne, &ldquo;now
sing an Italian song for us like Miss Croker.&nbsp; Pray, Miss
Croker, favour us with a song.&nbsp; Mrs. Theresa Tattle has
never had the pleasure of hearing you sing; she&rsquo;s quite
impatient to hear you sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa.</p>
<p>Frederick put his hands before him affectedly; &ldquo;Oh,
indeed, ma&rsquo;am! indeed, ladies! I really am so hoarse, it
distresses me so to be pressed to sing; besides, upon my word, I
have quite left off singing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never sung once,
except for very particular people, this winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; But Mrs. Theresa Tattle is a very particular
person.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll sing for her.</p>
<p><i>Fred.</i>&nbsp; Certainly, ma&rsquo;am, I allow that you
use a powerful argument; but I assure you now, I would do my best
to oblige you, but I absolutely have forgotten all my English
songs.&nbsp; Nobody hears anything but Italian now, and I have
been so giddy as to leave my Italian music behind me.&nbsp;
Besides, I make it a rule never to hazard myself without an
accompaniment.</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; Oh, try, Miss Croker, for once.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Frederick sings</i>, <i>after
much preluding</i>.]</p>
<blockquote><p>Violante in the pantry,<br />
Gnawing of a mutton-bone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How she gnawed it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How she claw&rsquo;d it,<br />
When she found herself alone!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Tattle; &ldquo;so like
Miss Croker, I&rsquo;m sure I shall think of you, Mr. Frederick,
when I hear her asked to sing again.&nbsp; Her voice, however,
introduces her to very pleasant parties, and she&rsquo;s a girl
that&rsquo;s very much taken notice of, and I don&rsquo;t doubt
will go off vastly well.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a particular favourite
of mine, you must know; and I mean to do her a piece of service
the first opportunity, by saying something or other, that shall
go round to her relations in Northumberland, and make them do
something for her; as well they may, for they are all rolling in
gold, and won&rsquo;t give her a penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mar.</i>&nbsp; Now, brother, read the newspaper like
Counsellor Puff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray do, Mr. Frederick, for I declare I admire you
of all things!&nbsp; You are quite yourself to-night.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s a newspaper, sir, pray let us have Counsellor
Puff.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not late.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Frederick reads in a pompous
voice</i>.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a
distinguishing ornament in either sex, Messrs. Valiant and Wise
conceive it to be their duty to take the earliest opportunity to
advertise the nobility and gentry of Great Britain in general,
and their friends in particular, that they have now ready for
sale, as usual, at the Hippocrates&rsquo; Head, a fresh
assortment of new-invented, much admired, primrose soap.&nbsp; To
prevent impositions and counterfeits, the public are requested to
take notice, that the only genuine primrose soap is stamped on
the outside, &lsquo;Valiant and Wise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you most incomparable mimic! &rsquo;tis absolutely
the counsellor himself.&nbsp; I absolutely must show you, some
day, to my friend Lady Battersby; you&rsquo;d absolutely make her
die with laughing; and she&rsquo;d quite adore you,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Theresa, who was well aware that every pause must be filled
with flattery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray go on, pray go on.&nbsp; I shall
never be tired, if I sit looking at you these hundred
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stimulated by these plaudits, Frederick proceeded to show how
Colonel Epaulette blew his nose, flourished his cambric
handkerchief, bowed to Lady Diana Periwinkle, and admired her
work, saying, &ldquo;Done by no hands, as you may guess, but
those of Fairly Fair.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whilst Lady Diana, he
observed, simpered so prettily, and took herself so quietly for
Fairly Fair, not perceiving that the colonel was admiring his own
nails all the while.</p>
<p>Next to Colonel Epaulette, Frederick, at Marianne&rsquo;s
particular desire, came into the room like Sir Charles Slang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, brother,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;your hand
down to the very bottom of your pocket, and your other shoulder
up to your ear; but you are not quite wooden enough, and you
should walk as if your hip were out of joint.&nbsp; There now,
Mrs. Tattle, are not those good eyes?&nbsp; They stare so like
his, without seeming to see anything all the while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent! admirable! Mr. Frederick.&nbsp; I must say
that you are the best mimic of your age I ever saw, and I&rsquo;m
sure Lady Battersby will think so too.&nbsp; That is Sir Charles
to the very life.&nbsp; But with all that, you must know
he&rsquo;s a mighty pleasant, fashionable young man when you come
to know him, and has a great deal of sense under all that, and is
of a very good family&mdash;the Slangs, you know.&nbsp; Sir
Charles will come into a fine fortune himself next year, if he
can keep clear of gambling, which I hear is his foible, poor
young man!&nbsp; Pray go on.&nbsp; I interrupt you, Mr.
Frederick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, brother,&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Marianne, I can do no more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite
tired, and I will do no more,&rdquo; said Frederick, stretching
himself at full length upon a sofa.</p>
<p>Even in the midst of laughter, and whilst the voice of
flattery yet sounded in his ear, Frederick felt sad, displeased
with himself, and disgusted with Mrs. Theresa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a deep sigh was there!&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa;
&ldquo;what can make you sigh so bitterly?&nbsp; You, who make
everybody else laugh.&nbsp; Oh, such another sigh
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne,&rdquo; cried Frederick, &ldquo;do you
remember the man in the mask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man in the mask, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man&mdash;the actor&mdash;the buffoon, that my
father told us of, who used to cry behind the mask that made
everybody else laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry! bless me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa, &ldquo;mighty
odd! very extraordinary! but one can&rsquo;t be surprised at
meeting with extraordinary characters amongst that race of
people, actors by profession, you know; for they are brought up
from the egg to make their fortune, or at least their bread by
their oddities.&nbsp; But, my dear Mr. Frederick, you are quite
pale, quite exhausted; no wonder&mdash;what will you have? a
glass of cowslip-wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Frederick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; indeed you must not leave me without taking
something; and Miss Marianne must have another macaroon.&nbsp; I
insist upon it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa, ringing the bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not late, and my man Christopher will bring up the
cowslip-wine in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sophy! and papa and mamma, you know, will come
home presently,&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Miss Sophy has her books and drawings.&nbsp; You
know she&rsquo;s never afraid of being alone.&nbsp; Besides,
to-night it was her own choice.&nbsp; And as to your papa and
mamma, they won&rsquo;t be home to-night, I&rsquo;m pretty sure;
for a gentleman, who had it from their own authority, told me
where they were going, which is further off than they think; but
they did not consult me; and I fancy they&rsquo;ll be obliged to
sleep out; so you need not be in a hurry about them.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll have candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened just as Mrs. Tattle was going to ring the bell
again for candles and the cowslip-wine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christopher!
Christopher!&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa, who was standing at the
fire, with her back to the door, when it opened,
&ldquo;Christopher! pray bring&mdash;Do you hear?&rdquo; but no
Christopher answered; and, upon turning round, Mrs. Tattle,
instead of Christopher, beheld two little black figures, which
stood perfectly still and silent.&nbsp; It was so dark, that
their forms could scarcely be discerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of heaven, who and what may you be?&nbsp;
Speak, I conjure you! what are ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chimney-sweepers, ma&rsquo;am, an&rsquo; please
your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chimney-sweepers!&rdquo; repeated Frederick and
Marianne, bursting out a-laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chimney-sweepers!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Theresa,
provoked at the recollection of her late solemn address to
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chimney-sweepers! and could not you say so a
little sooner?&nbsp; Pray, what brings you here, gentlemen, at
this time of night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bell rang, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;, answered a
squeaking voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bell rang! yes, for Christopher.&nbsp; The
boy&rsquo;s mad, or drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the tallest of the
chimney-sweepers, who had not yet spoken, and who now began in a
very blunt manner; &ldquo;ma&rsquo;am, your brother desired us to
come up when the bell rang; so we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother?&nbsp; I have no brother, dunce,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Theresa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Eden, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tattle, in a more complacent
tone, &ldquo;the boy takes me for Miss Bertha Eden, I
perceive&rdquo;; and, flattered to be taken in the dark by a
chimney-sweeper for a young and handsome lady, Mrs. Theresa
laughed, and informed him &ldquo;that they had mistaken the room;
and they must go up another pair of stairs, and turn to the
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chimney-sweeper with the squeaking voice bowed, thanked
her ladyship for this information, said, &ldquo;Good night to ye,
quality&rdquo;; and they both moved towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tattle, whose curiosity was
excited; &ldquo;what can the Edens want with chimney-sweepers at
this time o&rsquo; night, I wonder?&nbsp; Christopher, did you
hear anything about it?&rdquo; said the lady to her footman, who
was now lighting the candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the servant,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say; but I&rsquo;ll step down below and
inquire.&nbsp; I heard them talking about it in the kitchen; but
I only got a word here and there, for I was hunting for the
snuff-dish, as I knew it must be for candles when I heard the
bell ring, ma&rsquo;am; so I thought to find the snuff-dish
before I answered the bell, for I knew it must be for candles you
rang.&nbsp; But, if you please, I&rsquo;ll step down now,
ma&rsquo;am, and see about the chimney-sweepers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, step down, do; and, Christopher, bring up the
cowslip-wine, and some more macaroons for my little
Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which Mrs. Tattle
was going to give her; for she was somewhat surprised at the
familiarity with which this lady talked to her footman.&nbsp; She
had not been accustomed to these familiarities in her father and
mother, and she did not like them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tattle to Christopher, who was
now returned, &ldquo;what is the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, the little fellow with the squeaking voice
has been telling me the whole story.&nbsp; The other morning,
ma&rsquo;am, early, he and the other were down the hill sweeping
in Paradise Row.&nbsp; Those chimneys, they say, are difficult;
and the square fellow, ma&rsquo;am, the biggest of the two boys,
got wedged in the chimney.&nbsp; The other little fellow was up
at the top at the time, and he heard the cry; but in his fright,
and all, he did not know what to do, ma&rsquo;am; for he looked
about from the top of the chimney, and not a soul could he see
stirring, but a few that he could not make attend to his screech;
the boy within almost stifling too.&nbsp; So he screeched, and
screeched, all he could; and by the greatest chance in life,
ma&rsquo;am, old Mr. Eden was just going down the hill to fetch
his morning walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Theresa, &ldquo;friend
Ephraim is one of your early risers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Marianne, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, ma&rsquo;am, hearing the screech, he turns and sees
the sweep; and at once he understands the
matter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he must have taken some time to
understand it,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Tattle, &ldquo;for
he&rsquo;s the slowest creature breathing, and the deafest in
company.&nbsp; Go on, Christopher.&nbsp; So the sweep did make
him hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he says, ma&rsquo;am; and so the old gentleman went
in and pulled the boy out of the chimney, with much ado,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Theresa; &ldquo;but did
old Eden go up the chimney himself after the boy, wig and
all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Christopher, with a look
of great delight, &ldquo;that was all as one, as the very
&rsquo;dentical words I put to the boy myself, when he telled me
his story.&nbsp; But, ma&rsquo;am, that was what I couldn&rsquo;t
get out of him, neither, rightly, for he is a churl&mdash;the big
boy that was stuck in the chimney, I mean; for when I put the
question to him about the wig, laughing like, he wouldn&rsquo;t
take it laughing like at all; but would only make answer to us
like a bear, &lsquo;He saved my life, that&rsquo;s all I
know&rsquo;; and this over again, ma&rsquo;am, to all the kitchen
round, that cross-questioned him.&nbsp; But I finds him stupid
and ill-mannered like, for I offered him a shilling, ma&rsquo;am,
myself, to tell about the wig; but he put it back in a way that
did not become such as he, to no lady&rsquo;s butler,
ma&rsquo;am; whereupon I turns to the slim fellow (and he&rsquo;s
smarterer, and more mannerly, ma&rsquo;am, with a tongue in his
head for his betters), but he could not resolve me my question
either; for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part
o&rsquo; the time: and when he came down Mr. Eden had his wig on,
but had his arm all bare and bloody, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Mr. Eden!&rdquo; exclaimed Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, miss,&rdquo; continued the servant, &ldquo;and the
chimney-sweep himself was so bruised, and must have been
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well! but he&rsquo;s alive now; go on with your
story, Christopher,&rdquo; said Mrs. T.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Chimney-sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day;
it&rsquo;s part of their trade, and it&rsquo;s a happy thing when
they come off with a few bruises. <a name="citation236"></a><a
href="#footnote236" class="citation">[236]</a>&nbsp; To be
sure,&rdquo; added she, observing that both Frederick and
Marianne looked displeased at this speech, &ldquo;to be sure, if
one may believe this story, there was some real
danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real danger! yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Marianne;
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure I think Mr. Eden was very
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it was a most commendable action, and quite
providential.&nbsp; So I shall take an opportunity of saying,
when I tell the story in all companies; and the boy may thank his
kind stars, I&rsquo;m sure, to the end of his days, for such an
escape&mdash;But pray, Christopher,&rdquo; said she, persisting
in her conversation with Christopher, who was now laying the
cloth for supper, &ldquo;pray, which house was it in Paradise
Row? where the Eagles or the Miss Ropers lodge? or
which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at my Lady Battersby&rsquo;s,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Theresa, &ldquo;I thought we
should get to the bottom of the affair at last.&nbsp; This is
excellent!&nbsp; This will make an admirable story for my Lady
Battersby the next time I see her.&nbsp; These Quakers are so
sly!&nbsp; Old Eden, I know, has long wanted to obtain an
introduction into that house; and a charming charitable expedient
hit upon!&nbsp; My Lady Battersby will enjoy this, of all
things.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Now</span>,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Theresa, turning to Frederick, as soon as the servant had left
the room, &ldquo;now, Mr. Frederick Montague, I have a
favour&mdash;such a favour&mdash;to ask of you; it&rsquo;s a
favour which only you can grant; you have such talents, and would
do the thing so admirably; and my Lady Battersby would quite
adore you for it.&nbsp; She will do me the honour to be here to
spend an evening to-morrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m convinced Mr. and
Mrs. Montague will find themselves obliged to stay out another
day, and I so long to show you off to her ladyship; and your
Doctor Carbuncle, and your Counsellor Puff, and your Miss Croker,
and all your charming characters.&nbsp; You must let me introduce
you to her ladyship to-morrow evening.&nbsp; Promise
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Frederick, &ldquo;I cannot
promise you any such thing, indeed.&nbsp; I am much obliged to
you; but indeed I cannot come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, my dear sir? why not?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
think I mean you should promise, if you are certain your papa and
mamma will be home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they do come home, I will ask them about it,&rdquo;
said Frederick, hesitating; for though he by no means wished to
accept the invitation, he had not yet acquired the necessary
power of decidedly saying No.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask them!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Theresa.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
dear sir, at your age, must you ask your papa and mamma about
such things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must! no, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Frederick;
&ldquo;but I said I would.&nbsp; I know I need not, because my
father and mother always let me judge for myself almost about
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about this, I am sure,&rdquo; cried Marianne.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Papa and mamma, you know, just as they were going away,
said, &lsquo;If Mrs. Theresa asks you to come, do as you think
best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa, &ldquo;you know
it rests with yourselves, if you may do as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I may, madam,&rdquo; said Frederick,
colouring from that species of emotion which is justly called
false shame, and which often conquers real shame; &ldquo;to be
sure, ma&rsquo;am, I may do as I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may make sure of you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa;
&ldquo;for now it would be downright rudeness to tell a lady you
won&rsquo;t do as she pleases.&nbsp; Mr. Frederick Montague,
I&rsquo;m sure, is too wellbred a young gentleman to do so
unpolite, so ungallant a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought
by the silly acquaintance of young people to confuse their simple
morality and clear good sense.&nbsp; A new and unintelligible
system is presented to them, in a language foreign to their
understanding, and contradictory to their feelings.&nbsp; They
hesitate between new motives and old principles.&nbsp; From the
fear of being thought ignorant, they become affected; and from
the dread of being thought to be children act like fools.&nbsp;
But all this they feel only when they are in the company of such
people as Mrs. Theresa Tattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Frederick began, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t mean to be rude; but I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me
from coming to drink tea with you to-morrow, because my father
and mother are not acquainted with Lady Battersby, and maybe they
might not like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care, take care,&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa,
laughing at his perplexity: &ldquo;you want to get off from
obliging me, and you don&rsquo;t know how.&nbsp; You had very
nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor
Lady Battersby.&nbsp; Now you know it&rsquo;s impossible that Mr.
and Mrs. Montague could have in nature the slightest objection to
introducing you to my Lady Battersby at my own house; for,
don&rsquo;t you know, that, besides her ladyship&rsquo;s many
unquestionable qualities, which one need not talk of, she is
cousin, but once removed, to the Trotters of
Lancashire&mdash;your mother&rsquo;s great favourites?&nbsp; And
there is not a person at the Wells, I&rsquo;ll venture to say,
could be of more advantage to your sister Sophy, in the way of
partners, when she comes to go the balls, which it&rsquo;s to be
supposed she will, some time or other; and as you are so good a
brother, that&rsquo;s a thing to be looked to, you know.&nbsp;
Besides, as to yourself, there&rsquo;s nothing her ladyship
delights in so much as in a good mimic; and she&rsquo;ll quite
adore you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want her to adore me,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Frederick, bluntly; then, correcting
himself, added, &ldquo;I mean for being a mimic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, my love?&nbsp; Between friends, can there be
any harm in showing one&rsquo;s talents?&nbsp; You that have such
talents to show.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll keep your secret, I&rsquo;ll
answer for her; and,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t
be afraid of her criticism; for, between you and me, she&rsquo;s
no great critic; so you&rsquo;ll come.&nbsp; Well, thank you,
that&rsquo;s settled.&nbsp; How you have made me beg and pray!
but you know your own value, I see; as you entertaining people
always do.&nbsp; One must ask a wit, like a fine singer, so
often.&nbsp; Well, but now for the favour I was going to ask
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick looked surprised; for he thought that the favour of
his company was what she meant: but she explained herself
farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the old Quaker who lodges above, old Ephraim
Eden&mdash;my Lady Battersby and I have so much diversion about
him.&nbsp; He is the best character, the oddest creature!&nbsp;
If you were but to see him come into the rooms with those stiff
skirts, or walking with his eternal sister Bertha, and his
everlasting broad-brimmed hat!&nbsp; One knows him a mile
off!&nbsp; But then his voice and way, and altogether, if one
could get them to the life, they&rsquo;d be better than anything
on the stage; better even than anything I&rsquo;ve seen to-night;
and I think you&rsquo;d make a capital Quaker for my Lady
Battersby; but then the thing is, one can never get to hear the
old quiz talk.&nbsp; Now you, who have so much invention and
cleverness&mdash;I have no invention myself; but could you not
hit upon some way of seeing him, so that you might get him by
heart?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you, who are so quick, would only
want to see him, and hear him, for half a minute, to be able to
take him off, so as to kill one with laughing.&nbsp; But I have
no invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as to the invention,&rdquo; said Frederick,
&ldquo;I know an admirable way of doing the thing, if that is
all; but then remember, I don&rsquo;t say I will do the thing,
for I will not.&nbsp; But I know a way of getting up into his
room, and seeing him, without his knowing me to be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell it me, you charming, clever
creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, remember, I do not say I will do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, let us hear it; and you shall do as you
please afterwards.&nbsp; Merciful goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Tattle, &ldquo;do my ears deceive me?&nbsp; I declare I looked
round, and thought I heard the squeaking chimney-sweeper was in
the room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I, Frederick, I declare,&rdquo; cried Marianne,
laughing, &ldquo;I never heard anything so like his voice in my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frederick imitated the squeaking voice of this chimney-sweeper
to great perfection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;this fellow is just my
height.&nbsp; The old Quaker, if my face were blackened, and if I
were to change clothes with the chimney-sweeper, I&rsquo;ll
answer for it, would never know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s an admirable invention!&nbsp; I give you
infinite credit for it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Theresa.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It shall, it must be done.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ring, and have
the fellow up this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; do not ring,&rdquo; said Frederick, stopping
her hand, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to do it.&nbsp; You know you
promised that I should do as I pleased.&nbsp; I only told you my
invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well; but only let me ring, and ask whether the
chimney-sweepers are below.&nbsp; You shall do as you please
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christopher, shut the door.&nbsp; Christopher,&rdquo;
said she to the servant who came up when she rang, &ldquo;pray
are the sweeps gone yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have they been up to old Eden yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, ma&rsquo;am; nor be not to go till the bell
rings; for Miss Bertha, ma&rsquo;am, was asleep a-lying down, and
her brother wouldn&rsquo;t have her wakened on no account
whatsomever.&nbsp; He came down hisself to the kitchen to the
sweeps, though; but wouldn&rsquo;t have, as I heard him say, his
sister waked for no account.&nbsp; But Miss Bertha&rsquo;s bell
will ring when she wakens for the sweeps, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas she wanted to see the boy as her brother saved, and I
suppose sent for him to give him something charitable,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind your suppositions,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Theresa; &ldquo;run down this very minute to the little squeaking
chimney-sweep, and send him up to me.&nbsp; Quick, but
don&rsquo;t let the other bear come up with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christopher, who had curiosity, as well as his mistress, when
he returned with the chimney-sweeper, prolonged his own stay in
the room by sweeping the hearth, throwing down the tongs and
shovel, and picking them up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Christopher!&nbsp; Christopher, that will
do, I say,&rdquo; Mrs. Theresa repeated in vain.&nbsp; She was
obliged to say, &ldquo;Christopher, you may go,&rdquo; before he
would depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she to Frederick, &ldquo;step in here
to the next room with this candle, and you&rsquo;ll be equipped
in an instant.&nbsp; Only just change clothes with the boy; only
just let me see what a charming chimney-sweeper you&rsquo;d make.
You shall do as you please afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll only change clothes with him, just to
show you for one minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Marianne to Mrs. Theresa whilst
Frederick was changing his clothes, &ldquo;I think Frederick is
right about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what, love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is in the right not to go up, though he can
do it so easily, to see that gentleman; I mean on purpose to
mimic and laugh at him afterwards.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think that
would be quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, pray, Miss Marianne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, because he is so good-natured to his sister.&nbsp;
He would not let her be wakened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, it&rsquo;s easy to be good in such little things;
and he won&rsquo;t have long to be good to her neither; for I
don&rsquo;t think she will trouble him long in this world,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Marianne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she&rsquo;ll die, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die! die with that beautiful colour in her
cheeks!&nbsp; How sorry her poor, poor brother will be!&nbsp; But
she will not die, I&rsquo;m sure, for she walks about and runs
upstairs so lightly!&nbsp; Oh, you must be quite mistaken, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m mistaken, Dr. Panado Cardamum&rsquo;s
mistaken too, then, that&rsquo;s my comfort.&nbsp; He says,
unless the waters work a miracle, she stands a bad chance; and
she won&rsquo;t follow my advice, and consult the doctor for her
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would frighten her to death, perhaps,&rdquo; said
Marianne.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope Frederick won&rsquo;t go up to
disturb her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lud, child, you are turned simpleton all of a sudden;
how can your brother disturb her more than the real
chimney-sweeper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right,&rdquo;
persisted Marianne, &ldquo;and I shall tell him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Miss Marianne, I don&rsquo;t commend you
now.&nbsp; Young ladies should not be so forward to give opinions
and advice to their elder brothers unasked; and I presume that
Mr. Frederick and I must know what&rsquo;s right as well as Miss
Marianne.&nbsp; Hush! here he is.&nbsp; Oh, the capital
figure!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Theresa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bravo,
bravo!&rdquo; cried she, as Frederick entered in the
chimney-sweeper&rsquo;s dress; and as he spoke, saying,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, please your ladyship, to dirt your
ladyship&rsquo;s carpet,&rdquo; she broke out into immoderate
raptures, calling him &ldquo;her charming chimney-sweeper!&rdquo;
and repeating that she knew beforehand the character would do for
him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Theresa instantly rang the bell, in spite of all
expostulation&mdash;ordered Christopher to send up the other
chimney-sweeper&mdash;triumphed in observing that Christopher did
not know Frederick when he came into the room; and offered to lay
any wager that the other chimney-sweeper would mistake him for
his companion.&nbsp; And so he did; and when Frederick spoke, the
voice was so very like, that it was scarcely possible that he
should have perceived the difference.</p>
<p>Marianne was diverted by this scene; but she started, when in
the midst of it they heard a bell ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the lady&rsquo;s bell, and we must
go,&rdquo; said the blunt chimney-sweeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, then, about your business,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Theresa, &ldquo;and here&rsquo;s a shilling for you, to drink, my
honest fellow.&nbsp; I did not know you were so much bruised when
I first saw you.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t detain you.&nbsp; Go,&rdquo;
said she, pushing Frederick towards the door.&nbsp; Marianne
sprang forward to speak to him; but Mrs. Theresa kept her off;
and, though Frederick resisted, the lady shut the door upon him
by superior force, and, having locked it, there was no
retreat.&nbsp; Mrs. Tattle and Marianne waited impatiently for
Frederick&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear them,&rdquo; cried Marianne, &ldquo;I hear them
coming downstairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; They listened again, and all was
silent.&nbsp; At length they suddenly heard a great noise of many
steps in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Theresa, &ldquo;it must
be your father and mother come back.&rdquo;&nbsp; Marianne ran to
unlock the room door, and Mrs. Theresa followed her into the
hall.&nbsp; The hall was rather dark, but under the lamp a crowd
of people, all the servants in the house having gathered
together.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Theresa approached, the crowd opened in silence, and
in the midst she beheld Frederick, with blood streaming from his
face.&nbsp; His head was held by Christopher; and the
chimney-sweeper was holding a basin for him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Merciful! what will become of me?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Theresa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bleeding! he&rsquo;ll bleed to death!&nbsp;
Can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a
minute?&nbsp; A key, a large key down his back&mdash;a
key&mdash;has nobody a key?&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Montague will be
here before he has done bleeding.&nbsp; A key! cobwebs! a puff
ball! for mercy&rsquo;s sake! Can nobody think of anything that
will stop blood in a minute?&nbsp; Gracious me! he&rsquo;ll bleed
to death, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bleed to death!&nbsp; Oh, my
brother!&rdquo; cried Marianne, catching hold of the words; and
terrified, she ran upstairs, crying, &ldquo;Sophy, oh, Sophy!
come down this minute, or he&rsquo;ll be dead!&nbsp; My
brother&rsquo;s bleeding to death!&nbsp; Sophy! Sophy! come down,
or he&rsquo;ll be dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go the basin, you,&rdquo; said Christopher, pulling
the basin out of the chimney-sweeper&rsquo;s hand, who had all
this time stood in silence; &ldquo;you are not fit to hold the
basin for a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him hold it,&rdquo; said Frederick; &ldquo;he did
not mean to hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than he deserves.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
certain sure he might have known well enough it was Mr. Frederick
all the time, and he&rsquo;d no business to go to
fight&mdash;such a one as he&mdash;with a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know he was a gentleman!&rdquo; said the
chimney-sweeper, &ldquo;how could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he, indeed!&rdquo; said Frederick; &ldquo;he
shall hold the basin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to hear him speak
like himself again, at anyrate,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Theresa.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And here comes Miss Sophy, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophy!&rdquo; cried Frederick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Sophy,
don&rsquo;t you come&mdash;don&rsquo;t look at me; you&rsquo;ll
despise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother! where? where?&rdquo; said Sophy, looking,
as she thought, at the two chimney-sweepers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Frederick,&rdquo; said Marianne:
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Sophy, don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; Mrs. Theresa
began; &ldquo;but gracious goodness!&nbsp; I wish Miss
Bertha&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant a female figure in white appeared upon the
stairs; she passed swiftly on, whilst everyone gave way before
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Miss Bertha!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Theresa,
catching hold of her gown to stop her, as she came near
Frederick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Miss Eden, your beautiful India
muslin! take care of the chimney sweeper, for heaven&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she pressed forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my brother, will he die?&rdquo; cried
Marianne, throwing her arms round her, and looking up as if to a
being of a superior order.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will he bleed to
death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my love!&rdquo; answered a sweet voice: &ldquo;do
not frighten thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done bleeding,&rdquo; said Frederick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Miss Marianne, if you would not make such a
rout,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Tattle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Bertha,
it&rsquo;s nothing but a frolic.&nbsp; You see Mr. Frederick
Montague only in a masquerade dress.&nbsp; Nothing in the world
but a frolic, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; You see he&rsquo;s stopped
bleeding.&nbsp; I was frightened out of my wits at first.&nbsp; I
thought it was his eye, but I see it&rsquo;s only his nose.&nbsp;
All&rsquo;s well that ends well.&nbsp; Mr. Frederick, we&rsquo;ll
keep your counsel.&nbsp; Pray, ma&rsquo;am, let us ask no
questions; it&rsquo;s only a boyish frolic.&nbsp; Come, Mr.
Frederick, this way, into my room, and I&rsquo;ll give you a
towel and some clean water, and you can get rid of this
masquerade dress.&nbsp; Make haste, for fear your father and
mother should drop in upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be afraid of thy father and mother.&nbsp; They
are surely thy best friends,&rdquo; said a voice.&nbsp; It was
the voice of an elderly gentleman, who now stood behind
Frederick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, oh, Mr. Eden,&rdquo; said Frederick, turning
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t betray me! for goodness&rsquo; sake!&rdquo;
whispered Mrs. Tattle, &ldquo;say nothing about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking about you.&nbsp; Let me
speak,&rdquo; cried he, pushing away her hand, which stopped his
mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall say nothing about you, I promise
you,&rdquo; said Frederick, with a look of contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but for your own sake, my dear sir, your papa and
mamma.&nbsp; Bless me! is not that Mrs. Montague&rsquo;s
carriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Sophy, &ldquo;is
not afraid of my father and mother&rsquo;s coming back.&nbsp; Let
him speak; he was going to speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Miss Sophia, I wouldn&rsquo;t hinder him
from speaking the truth; but it&rsquo;s not proper, I presume,
ma&rsquo;am, to speak truth at all times, and in all places, and
before everybody, servants and all.&nbsp; I only wanted,
ma&rsquo;am, to hinder your brother from exposing himself.&nbsp;
A hall, I apprehend, is not a proper place for
explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Mr. Eden, opening the door of his
room, which was on the opposite side of the hall to Mrs.
Tattle&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is a place,&rdquo; said he to
Frederick, &ldquo;where thou mayst speak the truth at all times,
and before everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my room&rsquo;s at Mr. Frederick Montague&rsquo;s
service, and my door&rsquo;s open too.&nbsp; This way,
pray,&rdquo; said she, pulling his arm.&nbsp; But Frederick broke
from her, and followed Mr. Eden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, will you forgive me?&rdquo; cried he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive thee!&mdash;and what have I to
forgive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive, brother, without asking what,&rdquo; said
Bertha, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall know all!&rdquo; cried Frederick; &ldquo;all
that concerns myself, I mean.&nbsp; Sir, I disguised myself in
this dress; I came up to your room to-night on purpose to see
you, without your knowing it, that I might mimic you.&nbsp; The
chimney-sweeper, where is he?&rdquo; said Frederick, looking
round; and he ran into the hall to see for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;May
he come in? he may&mdash;he is a brave, an honest, good, grateful
boy.&nbsp; He never guessed who I was.&nbsp; After we left you we
went down to the kitchen together, and there, fool as I was, for
the pleasure of making Mr. Christopher and the servants laugh,
began to mimic you.&nbsp; This boy said he would not stand by and
hear you laughed at; that you had saved his life; that I ought to
be ashamed of myself; that you had just given me half a crown;
and so you had; but I went on, and told him I&rsquo;d knock him
down if he said another word.&nbsp; He did; I gave the first
blow; we fought; I came to the ground; the servants pulled me up
again.&nbsp; They found out, I don&rsquo;t know how, that I was
not a chimney-sweeper.&nbsp; The rest you saw.&nbsp; And now can
you forgive me, sir?&rdquo; said Frederick to Mr. Eden, seizing
hold of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other hand, friend,&rdquo; said the Quaker, gently
withdrawing his right hand, which everybody now observed was much
swelled, and putting it into his bosom again.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,
and welcome,&rdquo; offering his other hand to Frederick, and
shaking his with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that other hand!&rdquo; said Frederick, &ldquo;that
was hurt, I remember.&nbsp; How ill I have
behaved&mdash;extremely ill!&nbsp; But this is a lesson that I
shall never forget as long as I live.&nbsp; I hope for the future
I shall behave like a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And like a man&mdash;and like a good man, I am sure
thou wilt,&rdquo; said the good Quaker, shaking Frederick&rsquo;s
hand affectionately; &ldquo;or I am much mistaken, friend, in
that black countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not mistaken,&rdquo; cried Marianne.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Frederick will never be persuaded again by anybody to do
what he does not think right: and now, brother, you may wash your
black countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just when Frederick had got rid of half his black countenance,
a double knock was heard at the door.&nbsp; It was Mr. and Mrs.
Montague.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will you do now?&rdquo; whispered
Mrs. Theresa to Frederick, as his father and mother came into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chimney-sweeper covered with blood!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. and Mrs. Montague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, I am Frederick,&rdquo; said he, stepping
forward towards them, as they stood in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frederick! my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, I&rsquo;m not hurt half so much as I
deserve; I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; interrupted Bertha, &ldquo;let my brother
tell the story this time.&nbsp; Thou hast told it once, and told
it well; no one but my brother could tell it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A story never tells so well the second time, to be
sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Theresa; &ldquo;but Mr. Eden will
certainly make the best of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without taking any notice of Mrs. Tattle, or her apprehensive
looks, Mr. Eden explained all he knew of the affair in a few
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your son,&rdquo; concluded he, &ldquo;will
quickly put off his dirty dress.&nbsp; The dress hath not stained
the mind; that is fair and honourable.&nbsp; When he found
himself in the wrong, he said so; nor was he in haste to conceal
his adventure from his father; this made me think well of both
father and son.&nbsp; I speak plainly, friend, for that is
best.&nbsp; But what is become of the other
chimney-sweeper?&nbsp; He will want to go home,&rdquo; said Mr.
Eden, turning to Mrs. Theresa.&nbsp; Without making any reply,
she hurried out of the room as fast as possible, and returned in
a few moments, with a look of extreme consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a catastrophe indeed!&nbsp; Now, indeed, Mr.
Frederick, your papa and mamma have reason to be angry.&nbsp; A
new suit of clothes!&mdash;the bare faced villain! gone! no sign
of them in my closet, or anywhere.&nbsp; The door was locked; he
must have gone up the chimney, out upon the leads, and so
escaped; but Christopher is after him.&nbsp; I protest, Mrs.
Montague, you take it too quietly.&nbsp; The wretch!&mdash;a new
suit of clothes, blue coat and buff waistcoat.&nbsp; I never
heard of such a thing!&nbsp; I declare, Mr. Montague, you are
vastly good, not to be in a passion,&rdquo; added Mrs.
Theresa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Mr. Montague, with a look of much
civil contempt, &ldquo;I think the loss of a suit of clothes, and
even the disgrace that my son has been brought to this evening,
fortunate circumstances in his education.&nbsp; He will, I am
persuaded, judge and act for himself more wisely in future.&nbsp;
Nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity, for the sake
of being called &lsquo;The best mimic in the
world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>THE
BARRING OUT; OR, PARTY SPIRIT.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> mother of
mischief,&rdquo; says an old proverb, &ldquo;is no bigger than a
midge&rsquo;s wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Doctor Middleton&rsquo;s school, there was a great tall
dunce of the name of Fisher, who never could be taught how to
look out a word in the dictionary.&nbsp; He used to torment
everybody with&mdash;&ldquo;Do pray help me!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
make out this one word.&rdquo;&nbsp; The person who usually
helped him in his distress was a very clever, good natured boy,
of the name of De Grey, who had been many years under Dr.
Middleton&rsquo;s care, and who, by his abilities and good
conduct, did him great credit.&nbsp; The doctor certainly was
both proud and fond of him; but he was so well beloved, or so
much esteemed by his companions, that nobody had ever called him
by the odious name of favourite, until the arrival of a new
scholar of the name of Archer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p246b.jpg">
<img alt=

"The Barring Out"

</a></p>
<p>Till Archer came, the ideas of <i>favourites</i> and
<i>parties</i> were almost unknown at Dr. Middleton&rsquo;s; but
he brought all these ideas fresh from a great public school, at
which he had been educated&mdash;at which he had acquired a
sufficient quantity of Greek and Latin, and a superabundant
quantity of party spirit.&nbsp; His aim, the moment he came to a
new school, was to get to the head of it, or at least to form the
strongest party.&nbsp; His influence, for he was a boy of
considerable abilities, was quickly felt, though he had a
powerful rival, as he thought proper to call him, in De Grey;
and, with <i>him</i>, a rival was always an enemy.&nbsp; De Grey,
so far from giving him any cause of hatred, treated him with a
degree of cordiality, which would probably have had an effect
upon Archer&rsquo;s mind, if it had not been for the artifices of
Fisher.</p>
<p>It may seem surprising, that a <i>great dunce</i> should be
able to work upon a boy like an Archer, who was called a great
genius; but when genius is joined to a violent temper, instead of
being united to good sense, it is at the mercy even of
dunces.</p>
<p>Fisher was mortally offended one morning by De Grey&rsquo;s
refusing to translate his whole lesson for him.&nbsp; He went
over to Archer, who, considering him as a partisan deserting from
the enemy, received him with open arms, and translated his whole
lesson without expressing <i>much</i> contempt for his
stupidity.&nbsp; From this moment Fisher forgot all De
Grey&rsquo;s former kindness, and considered only how he could in
his turn mortify the person whom he felt to be so much his
superior.</p>
<p>De Grey and Archer were now reading for a premium, which was
to be given in their class.&nbsp; Fisher betted on Archer&rsquo;s
head, who had not sense enough to despise the bet of a
blockhead.&nbsp; On the contrary he suffered him to excite the
spirit of rivalship in its utmost fury by collecting the bets of
all the school.&nbsp; So that this premium now became a matter of
the greatest consequence, and Archer, instead of taking the means
to secure a judgment in his favour, was listening to the opinions
of all his companions.&nbsp; It was a prize which was to be won
by his own exertions; but he suffered himself to consider it as
an affair of chance.&nbsp; The consequence was, that he trusted
to chance&mdash;his partisans lost their wagers, and he the
premium&mdash;and his temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Archer,&rdquo; said Dr. Middleton, after the grand
affair was decided, &ldquo;you have done all that genius alone
could do; but you, De Grey, have done all that genius and
industry united could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Archer, with affected gaiety, as
soon as the doctor had left the room&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m
content with <i>my</i> sentence.&nbsp; Genius alone! for
me&mdash;industry for those who <i>want</i> it,&rdquo; added he,
with a significant look at De Grey.</p>
<p>Fisher applauded this as a very spirited speech; and, by
insinuations that Dr. Middleton &ldquo;always gave the premium to
De Grey,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;those who had lost their bets
might thank themselves for it, for being such simpletons as to
bet against the favourite,&rdquo; he raised a murmur highly
flattering to Archer, amongst some of the most credulous boys;
whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr.
Middleton&rsquo;s impartiality.&nbsp; These warmly congratulated
De Grey.&nbsp; At this Archer grew more and more angry, and when
Fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense <i>for</i> him, pushed
forward into the circle to De Grey, crying, &ldquo;I wish, Mr.
Fisher, you would let me fight my own battles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>I</i> wish,&rdquo; said young Townsend, who was
fonder of diversions than of premiums, or battles, or of anything
else&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I</i> wish, that we were not to have any
battles; after having worked like horses, don&rsquo;t set about
to fight like dogs.&nbsp; Come,&rdquo; said he, tapping De
Grey&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;let us see your new playhouse,
do&mdash;it&rsquo;s a holiday, and let us make the most of
it.&nbsp; Let us have the &lsquo;School for Scandal,&rsquo; do;
and I&rsquo;ll play Charles for you, and you, De Grey, shall be
<i>my little Premium</i>.&nbsp; Come, do open this new playhouse
of yours to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come then!&rdquo; said De Grey, and he ran across the
playground to a waste building at the farthest end of it, in
which, at the earnest request of the whole community, and with
the permission of Dr. Middleton, he had with much pain and
ingenuity erected a theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new theatre is going to be opened!&nbsp; Follow the
manager!&nbsp; Follow the manager!&rdquo; echoed a multitude of
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Follow the manager</i>!&rdquo; echoed very
disagreeably in Archer&rsquo;s ear; but as he could not be
<i>left alone</i>, he was also obliged to follow the
manager.&nbsp; The moment that the door was unlocked, the crowd
rushed in: the delight and wonder expressed at the sight was
great, and the applause and thanks which were bestowed upon the
manager were long and loud.</p>
<p>Archer at least thought them long, for he was impatient till
his voice could be heard.&nbsp; When at length the acclamations
had spent themselves, he walked across the stage with a knowing
air, and looking round contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is <i>this</i> your famous playhouse?&rdquo; cried
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you had, any of you, seen the playhouse
<i>I</i> have been used to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words made a great and visible change in the feelings
and opinions of the public.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who would be a servant
of the public? or who would toil for popular
applause?&rdquo;&nbsp; A few words spoken in a decisive tone by a
new voice operated as a charm, and the playhouse was in an
instant metamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators.&nbsp; All
gratitude for the past was forgotten, and the expectation of
something better justified to the capricious multitude their
disdain of what they had so lately pronounced to be
excellent.</p>
<p>Everyone now began to criticise.&nbsp; One observed,
&ldquo;that the green curtain was full of holes, and would not
draw up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another attacked the scenes; &ldquo;Scenes!
they were not like real scenes&mdash;Archer must know best,
because he was used to these things.&rdquo;&nbsp; So everybody
crowded to hear something of the <i>other</i> playhouse.&nbsp;
They gathered round Archer to hear the description of his
playhouse, and at every sentence insulting comparisons were
made.&nbsp; When he had done, his auditors looked round, sighed
and wished that Archer had been their manager.&nbsp; They turned
from De Grey as from a person who had done them an injury.&nbsp;
Some of his friends&mdash;for he had friends who were not swayed
by the popular opinion&mdash;felt indignation at this
ingratitude, and were going to express their feelings; but De
Grey stopped them, and begged that he might speak for
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, coming forward, as soon as
he felt that he had sufficient command of himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My friends, I see you are discontented with me and my
playhouse.&nbsp; I have done my best to please you; but if
anybody else can please you better, I shall be glad of it.&nbsp;
I did not work so hard for the glory of being your manager.&nbsp;
You have my free leave to tear down&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here his
voice faltered, but he hurried on&mdash;&ldquo;You have my free
leave to tear down all my work as fast as you please.&nbsp;
Archer, shake hands first, however, to show that there&rsquo;s no
malice in the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archer, who was touched by what his rival said, and, stopping
the hand of his new partisan, Fisher, cried, &ldquo;No, Fisher!
no!&mdash;no pulling down.&nbsp; We can alter it.&nbsp; There is
a great deal of ingenuity in it, considering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In vain Archer would now have recalled the public to
reason,&mdash;the time for reason was passed: enthusiasm had
taken hold of their minds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down with it!&nbsp; Down
with it!&nbsp; Archer for ever!&rdquo; cried Fisher, and tore
down the curtain.&nbsp; The riot once begun, nothing could stop
the little mob, till the whole theatre was demolished.&nbsp; The
love of power prevailed in the mind of Archer; he was secretly
flattered by the zeal of his <i>party</i>, and he mistook their
love of mischief for attachment to himself.&nbsp; De Grey looked
on superior.&nbsp; &ldquo;I said I could bear to see all this,
and I can,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;now it is all
over.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now it was all over, there was
silence.&nbsp; The rioters stood still to take breath, and to
look at what they had done.&nbsp; There was a blank space before
them.</p>
<p>In this moment of silence there was heard something like a
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; What strange voice is
that?&rdquo; said Archer.&nbsp; Fisher caught fast hold of his
arm.&nbsp; Everybody looked round to see where the voice came
from.&nbsp; It was dusk.&nbsp; Two window-shutters at the
farthest end of the building were seen to move slowly
inwards.&nbsp; De Grey, and in the same instant Archer, went
forward; and, as the shutters opened, there appeared through the
hole the dark face and shrivelled hands of a very old
gipsy.&nbsp; She did not speak; but she looked first at one and
then at another.&nbsp; At length she fixed her eyes on De
Grey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what do
you want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want!&mdash;nothing&mdash;with <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said
the old woman; &ldquo;do you want nothing with
<i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said De Grey.&nbsp; Her eye immediately
turned upon Archer,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>You</i> want something with
me,&rdquo; said she, with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;what do I want?&rdquo; replied Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, changing her tone, &ldquo;you want
nothing&mdash;nothing will you ever want, or I am much mistaken
in that <i>face</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that <i>watch-chain</i>, she should have said, for her
quick eye had espied Archer&rsquo;s watch-chain.&nbsp; He was the
only person in the company who had a watch, and she therefore
judged him to be the richest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you ever your fortune told, sir, in your
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; said he, looking at De Grey, as if he was
afraid of his ridicule, if he listened to the gipsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you!&nbsp; No! for you will make your own fortune,
and the fortune of all that belong to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s good news for my friends!&rdquo; cried
Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m one of them, remember that,&rdquo; cried
Fisher.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; joined a
number of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to them!&rdquo; cried the gipsy, &ldquo;good
luck to them all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as soon as they had acquired sufficient confidence in
her good will, they pressed up to the window.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried Townsend, as he chanced to stumble
over the carpenter&rsquo;s mitre box, which stood in the way,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a good omen for me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
stumbled on the mitre box; I shall certainly be a
bishop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happy he who had sixpence, for he bid fair to be a judge upon
the bench.&nbsp; And happier he who had a shilling, for he was in
the high road to be one day upon the woolsack, Lord High
Chancellor of England.&nbsp; No one had half a crown, or no one
would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an occasion,
for he might have been an archbishop, a king, or what he
pleased.</p>
<p>Fisher, who like all weak people was extremely credulous, kept
his post immovable in the front row all the time, his mouth open,
and his stupid eyes fixed upon the gipsy, in whom he felt
implicit faith.</p>
<p>Those who have least confidence in their own powers, and who
have least expectation from the success of their own exertions,
are always most disposed to trust in fortune-tellers and
fortune.&nbsp; They hope to <i>win</i>, when they cannot
<i>earn</i>; and as they can never be convinced by those who
speak sense, it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those
who talk nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a question to put,&rdquo; said Fisher, in a
solemn tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it, then,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;what hinders
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will hear me,&rdquo; said he, looking
suspiciously at De Grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> shall not hear you,&rdquo; said De Grey,
&ldquo;I am going.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everybody else drew back, and
left him to whisper his question in the gipsy&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is become of my Livy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your <i>sister</i> Livy, do you mean?&rdquo; said the
gipsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my <i>Latin</i> Livy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gipsy paused for information.&nbsp; &ldquo;It had a leaf
torn out in the beginning, and <i>I hate Dr.
Middleton</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Written in it,&rdquo; interrupted the gipsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right&mdash;the very book!&rdquo; cried Fisher with
joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how <i>could</i> you know it was Dr.
Middleton&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; I thought I had scratched it, so
that nobody could make it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody <i>could</i> make it out but <i>me</i>,&rdquo;
replied the gipsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;But never think to deceive
me,&rdquo; said she, shaking her head at him in a manner that
made him tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deceive you indeed, I tell you the whole
truth.&nbsp; I lost it a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when shall I find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet me here at this hour to-morrow evening, and I will
answer you.&nbsp; No more!&nbsp; I must be gone.&nbsp; Not a word
more to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pulled the shutters towards her, and left the youth in
darkness.&nbsp; All his companions were gone.&nbsp; He had been
so deeply engaged in this conference, that he had not perceived
their departure.&nbsp; He found all the world at supper, but no
entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his secret.&nbsp;
Townsend rallied in vain.&nbsp; As for Archer, he was not
disposed to destroy by ridicule the effect which he saw that the
old woman&rsquo;s predictions in his favour had had upon the
imagination of many of his little partisans.&nbsp; He had
privately slipped two good shillings into the gipsy&rsquo;s hand
to secure her; for he was willing to pay any price for <i>any</i>
means of acquiring power.</p>
<p>The watch-chain had not deceived the gipsy, for Archer was the
richest person in the community.&nbsp; His friends had
imprudently supplied him with more money than is usually trusted
to boys of his age.&nbsp; Dr. Middleton had refused to give him a
larger monthly allowance than the rest of his companions; but he
brought to school with him secretly the sum of five
guineas.&nbsp; This appeared to his friends and to himself an
inexhaustible treasure.</p>
<p>Riches and talents would, he flattered himself, secure to him
that ascendancy of which he was so ambitious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Am I
your manager, or not?&rdquo; was now his question.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment; but since last night
you have had time to consider.&nbsp; If you desire me to be your
manager, you shall see what a theatre I will make for you.&nbsp;
In this purse,&rdquo; said he, showing through the network a
glimpse of the shining treasure&mdash;&ldquo;in this purse is
Aladdin&rsquo;s wonderful lamp.&nbsp; Am I your manager?&nbsp;
Put it to the vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was put to the vote.&nbsp; About ten of the most reasonable
of the assembly declared their gratitude and high approbation of
their old friend, De Grey; but the numbers were in favour of the
new friend.&nbsp; And as no metaphysical distinctions relative to
the idea of a majority had ever entered their thoughts, the most
numerous party considered themselves as now beyond dispute in the
right.&nbsp; They drew off on one side in triumph, and their
leader, who knew the consequence of a name in party matters,
immediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of
<i>Archers</i>, stigmatizing the friends of De Grey by the odious
epithet of Greybeards.</p>
<p>Amongst the Archers was a class not very remarkable for their
mental qualifications; but who, by their bodily activity, and by
the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life, rendered
themselves of the highest consequence, especially to the rich and
enterprising.</p>
<p>The judicious reader will apprehend that I allude to the
persons called day scholars.&nbsp; Amongst these, Fisher was
distinguished by his knowledge of all the streets and shops in
the adjacent town; and, though a dull scholar, he had such
reputation as a man of business, that whoever had commissions to
execute at the confectioner&rsquo;s, was sure to apply to
him.&nbsp; Some of the youngest of his employers had, it is true,
at times complained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence
in their accounts; but as these affairs could never be brought to
a public trial, Fisher&rsquo;s character and consequence were
undiminished, till the fatal day when his Aunt Barbara forbade
his visits to the confectioner&rsquo;s; or, rather, till she
requested the confectioner, who had his private reasons for
obeying her, not <i>to receive</i> her nephew&rsquo;s visits, as
he had made himself sick at his house, and Mrs. Barbara&rsquo;s
fears for his health were incessant.</p>
<p>Though his visits to the confectioner&rsquo;s were thus at an
end, there were many other shops open to him; and with officious
zeal he offered his services to the new manager, to purchase
whatever might be wanting for the theatre.</p>
<p>Since his father&rsquo;s death Fisher had become a boarder at
Dr. Middleton&rsquo;s, but his frequent visits to his Aunt
Barbara afforded him opportunities of going into the town.&nbsp;
The carpenter, De Grey&rsquo;s friend, was discarded by Archer,
for having said &ldquo;<i>lack-a-daisy</i>!&rdquo; when he saw
that the old theatre was pulled down.&nbsp; A new carpenter and
paper hanger, recommended by Fisher, were appointed to attend,
with their tools, for orders, at two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Archer,
impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity, gave his plan
and his orders in a few minutes, in a most decided manner;
&ldquo;These things,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;should be done
with some spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the carpenter readily assented, and added, that
&ldquo;gentlemen of spirit never looked to the <i>expense</i>,
but always to the <i>effect</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon this principle
Mr. Chip set to work with all possible alacrity.&nbsp; In a few
hours&rsquo; time he promised to produce a grand effect.&nbsp;
High expectations were formed.&nbsp; Nothing was talked of but
the new playhouse; and so intent upon it was every head, that no
lessons could be got.&nbsp; Archer was obliged, in the midst of
his various occupations, to perform the part of grammar and
dictionary for twenty different people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ye Athenians!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how hard do
I work to obtain your praise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impatient to return to the theatre, the moment the hours
destined for instruction, or, as they are termed by schoolboys,
school-hours, were over, each prisoner started up with a shout of
joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop one moment, gentlemen, if you please,&rdquo; said
Dr. Middleton, in an awful voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Archer, return
to your place.&nbsp; Are you all here?&rdquo;&nbsp; The names of
all the boys were called over, and when each had answered to his
name, Dr. Middleton said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I am sorry to interrupt your amusements;
but, till you have contrary orders from me, no one, on pain of my
serious displeasure, must go into <i>that</i> building&rdquo;
(pointing to the place where the theatre was erecting).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Archer, your carpenter is at the door.&nbsp; You will
be so good as to dismiss him.&nbsp; I do not think proper to give
my reasons for these orders; but you who <i>know</i> me,&rdquo;
said the doctor, and his eye turned towards De Grey, &ldquo;will
not suspect me of caprice.&nbsp; I depend, gentlemen, upon your
obedience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the dead silence with which these orders were received,
succeeded in a few minutes a universal groan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Townsend, &ldquo;all our diversion is
over.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So,&rdquo; whispered Fisher in the
manager&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;this is some trick of the
Greybeard&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Did you not observe how he looked at De
Grey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fired by this thought, which had never entered his mind
before, Archer started from his reverie, and striking his hand
upon the table, swore that he &ldquo;would not be outwitted by
any Greybeard in Europe&mdash;no, nor by all of them put
together.&nbsp; The Archers were surely a match for them.&nbsp;
He would stand by them, if they would stand by him,&rdquo; he
declared, with a loud voice, &ldquo;against the whole world, and
Dr. Middleton himself, with &lsquo;<i>Little Premiums</i>&rsquo;
at his right hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody admired Archer&rsquo;s spirit, but were a little
appalled at the sound of standing against Dr. Middleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; resumed the indignant manager.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Neither Dr. Middleton nor any doctor upon earth shall
treat me with injustice.&nbsp; This, you see, is a stroke at me
and my party, and I won&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are mistaken!&rdquo; said De Grey, who was the
only one who dared to oppose reason to the angry orator.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It cannot be a stroke aimed at &lsquo;you and your
party,&rsquo; for he does not know that you <i>have</i> a
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him know it, and I&rsquo;ll make
<i>you</i> know it, too,&rdquo; said Archer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before
I came here you reigned alone, now your reign is over, Mr. De
Grey.&nbsp; Remember my majority this morning, and your theatre
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has remembered it,&rdquo; said Fisher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You see, the moment he was not to be our manager, we were
to have no theatre, no playhouse, no plays.&nbsp; We must all sit
down with our hands before us&mdash;all for &lsquo;<i>good
reasons</i>&rsquo; of Dr. Middleton&rsquo;s, which he does not
vouchsafe to tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be governed by any man&rsquo;s reasons
that he won&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; cried Archer.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
cannot have good reasons, or why not tell them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said De Grey.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>We shall
not suspect him of caprice</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we who know him, have never known him
capricious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not.&nbsp; <i>I</i> know nothing about
him,&rdquo; said Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said De Grey; &ldquo;for that very reason
<i>I</i> speak who do know him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be in a
passion, Archer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be in a passion.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t submit to
tyranny.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t be made a fool of by a few soft
words.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know me, De Grey.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
go through with what I&rsquo;ve begun.&nbsp; I am manager, and I
will be manager; and you shall see my theatre finished in spite
of you, and <i>my</i> party triumphant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Party,&rdquo; repeated De Grey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot
imagine what is in the word &lsquo;party&rsquo; that seems to
drive you mad.&nbsp; We never heard of parties till you came
amongst us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; before I came, I say, nobody dared oppose you; but
I dare; and I tell you to your face, take care of me&mdash;a warm
friend and a bitter enemy is my motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not your enemy!&nbsp; I believe you are out of
your senses, Archer!&rdquo; said he, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of my senses!&nbsp; No; you are my enemy!&nbsp; Are
you not my rival?&nbsp; Did not you win the premium?&nbsp; Did
not you want to be manager?&nbsp; Answer me, are not you, in one
word, a Greybeard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You called me a Greybeard, but my name is De
Grey,&rdquo; said he, still laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh on!&rdquo; cried the other, furiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, <i>Archers</i>, follow me.&nbsp; <i>We</i> shall
laugh by-and-by, I promise you.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the door Archer
was stopped by Mr. Chip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Chip, I am ordered
to discharge you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; and here&rsquo;s a little
bill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, Mr. Chip! why, you have not been at work for two
hours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much over, sir; but if you&rsquo;ll please to look
into it, you&rsquo;ll see &rsquo;tis for a few things you
ordered.&nbsp; The stuff is all laid out and delivered.&nbsp; The
paper and the festoon-bordering for the drawing room scene is cut
out, and left yAnder within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y<i>a</i>nder, within!&nbsp; I wish you had not been in
such a confounded hurry&mdash;six-and-twenty shillings!&rdquo;
cried he; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t stay to talk about it
now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you, Mr. Chip,&rdquo; said Archer,
lowering his voice, &ldquo;what you must do for me, my good
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, drawing Mr. Chip aside, he begged him to pull down some
of the wood work which had been put up, and to cut it into a
certain number of wooden bars, of which he gave him the
dimensions, with orders to place them all, when ready, under a
haystack, which he pointed out.</p>
<p>Mr. Chip scrupled and hesitated, and began to talk of
&ldquo;<i>the doctor</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Archer immediately began
to talk of the bill, and throwing down a guinea and a half, the
conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly, and made his
bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Master Archer,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no refusing you nothing.&nbsp; You have such
a way of talking one out of it.&nbsp; You manage me just like a
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; said Archer, knowing that he had been
cheated, and yet proud of managing a carpenter, &ldquo;ay,
ay!&nbsp; I know the way to manage everybody.&nbsp; Let the
things be ready in an hour&rsquo;s time, and hark&rsquo;e! leave
your tools by mistake behind you, and a thousand of twenty-penny
nails.&nbsp; Ask no questions, and keep your own counsel like a
wise man.&nbsp; Off with you, and take care of &lsquo;<i>the
doctor</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Archers, Archers, to the Archers&rsquo; tree!&nbsp;
Follow your leader,&rdquo; cried he, sounding his well known
whistle as a signal.&nbsp; His followers gathered round him, and
he, raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the tree,
counted his numbers, and then, in a voice lower than usual,
addressed them thus:&mdash;&ldquo;My friends, is there a
Greybeard amongst us?&nbsp; If there is, let him walk off at
once, he has my free leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one stirred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then we are all Archers, and we will stand by one
another.&nbsp; Join hands, my friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; They all
joined hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Promise me not to betray me, and I
will go on.&nbsp; I ask no security but your honour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They all gave their honour to be secret and <i>faithful</i>, as
he called it, and he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever hear of
such a thing as a &lsquo;<i>Barring Out</i>,&rsquo; my
friends?&rdquo;&nbsp; They had heard of such a thing, but they
had only heard of it.</p>
<p>Archer gave the history of a &ldquo;Barring Out,&rdquo; in
which he had been concerned at his school, in which the boys
stood out against the master, and gained their point at last,
which was a week&rsquo;s more holidays at Easter. <a
name="citation256"></a><a href="#footnote256"
class="citation">[256]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;But if <i>we</i> should
not succeed,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;Dr. Middleton is so steady;
he never goes back from what he has said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever try to push him back?&nbsp; Let us be
steady and he&rsquo;ll tremble.&nbsp; Tyrants always tremble
when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; interrupted a number of voices; &ldquo;but
he is not a tyrant&mdash;is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All schoolmasters are tyrants&mdash;are not
they?&rdquo; replied Archer; &ldquo;and is not he a
schoolmaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this logic there was no answer; but, still reluctant, they
asked, &ldquo;What they should <i>get</i> by a Barring
Out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get!&mdash;everything!&mdash;what we want!&mdash;which
is everything to lads of spirit&mdash;victory and liberty!&nbsp;
Bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law; till he lets us
into our own theatre again, or till he tells us his
&lsquo;<i>good reasons</i>&rsquo; against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps he has reasons for not telling
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried Archer, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig, who says
he has good reasons, and can&rsquo;t tell them.&nbsp; Are you
fools?&nbsp; Go! go back to De Grey!&nbsp; I see you are all
Greybeards.&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; Who goes first?&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody
would go <i>first</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will have nothing to do
with ye, if ye are resolved to be slaves!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t be slaves!&rdquo; they all exclaimed at once.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;stand out in the right
and be free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The right</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would have taken up
too much time to examine what &ldquo;the right&rdquo; was.&nbsp;
Archer was always sure that &ldquo;<i>the right</i>&rdquo; was
what his party chose to do; that is, what he chose to do himself;
and such is the influence of numbers upon each other, in
conquering the feelings of shame and in confusing the powers of
reasoning, that in a few minutes &ldquo;the right&rdquo; was
forgotten, and each said to himself, &ldquo;To be sure, Archer is
a very clever boy, and he can&rsquo;t be mistaken&rdquo;; or,
&ldquo;to be sure, Townsend thinks so, and he would not do
anything to get us into a scrape&rdquo;; or, &ldquo;to be sure,
everybody will agree to this but myself, and I can&rsquo;t stand
out alone, to be pointed at as a Greybeard and a slave.&nbsp;
Everybody thinks it is right, and everybody can&rsquo;t be
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By some of these arguments, which passed rapidly through the
mind without his being conscious of them, each boy decided, and
deceived himself&mdash;what none would have done alone, none
scrupled to do as a party.&nbsp; It was determined, then, that
there should be a Barring Out.&nbsp; The arrangement of the
affair was left to their new manager, to whom they all pledged
implicit obedience.&nbsp; Obedience, it seems, is necessary, even
from rebels to their ringleaders; not reasonable, but implicit
obedience.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the assembly adjourned to the Ball-alley, when
Fisher, with an important length of face, came up to the manager,
and desired to speak one word to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;My advice to
you, Archer, is, to do nothing in this till we have consulted,
<i>you know who</i>, about whether it&rsquo;s right or
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>You know who</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; Whom do you
mean?&nbsp; Make haste, and don&rsquo;t make so many faces, for
I&rsquo;m in a hurry.&nbsp; Who is &lsquo;<i>You know
who</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old woman,&rdquo; said Fisher, gravely; &ldquo;the
gipsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may consult the old woman,&rdquo; said Archer,
bursting out a-laughing, &ldquo;about what&rsquo;s right and
wrong, if you please; but no old woman shall decide for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but you don&rsquo;t <i>take</i> me,&rdquo; said
Fisher; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t <i>take</i> me.&nbsp; By right and
wrong, I mean lucky and unlucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever <i>I</i> do will be lucky,&rdquo; replied
Archer.&nbsp; &ldquo;My gipsy told you that already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Fisher, &ldquo;and what she
said about your friends being lucky&mdash;that went a great way
with many,&rdquo; added he, with a sagacious nod of his head;
&ldquo;I can tell you <i>that</i>&mdash;more than you
think.&nbsp; Do you know,&rdquo; said he, laying hold of
Archer&rsquo;s button, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the secret.&nbsp;
There are nine of us have crooked our little fingers upon it, not
to stir a step till we get her advice; and she has appointed me
to meet her about particular business of my own at eight.&nbsp;
So I&rsquo;m to consult her and to bring her answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archer knew too well how to govern fools, to attempt to reason
with them; and, instead of laughing any longer at Fisher&rsquo;s
ridiculous superstition, he was determined to take advantage of
it.&nbsp; He affected to be persuaded of the wisdom of the
measure; looked at his watch; urged him to be exact to a moment;
conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle; and,
above all things, to demand the lucky hour and minute when the
Barring Out should begin.&nbsp; With these instructions Archer
put his watch into the solemn dupe&rsquo;s hand, and left him to
count the seconds, till the moment of his appointment, whilst he
ran off himself to prepare the oracle.</p>
<p>At a little gate which looked into a lane, through which he
guessed that the gipsy must pass, he stationed himself, saw her,
gave her half a crown and her instructions, made his escape, and
got back unsuspected to Fisher, whom he found in the attitude in
which he had left him, watching the motion of the minute
hand.</p>
<p>Proud of his secret commission, Fisher slouched his hat, he
knew not why, over his face, and proceeded towards the appointed
spot.&nbsp; To keep, as he had been charged by Archer, within the
letter of the law, he stood <i>behind</i> the forbidden building,
and waited some minutes.</p>
<p>Through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her
appearance, muffled up, and looking cautiously about her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody near us!&rdquo; said Fisher, and he
began to be a little afraid.&nbsp; &ldquo;What answer,&rdquo;
said he, recollecting himself, &ldquo;about my Livy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost! lost! lost!&rdquo; said the gipsy, lifting up her
hands; &ldquo;never, never, never to be found!&nbsp; But no
matter for that now; that is not your errand to-night; no tricks
with me; speak to me of what is next your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fisher, astonished, put his hand upon his heart, told her all
that she knew before, and received the answers that Archer had
dictated: &ldquo;That the Archers should be lucky as long as they
stuck to their manager, and to one another; that the Barring Out
should end in woe, if not begun precisely as the clock should
strike nine on Wednesday night; but if begun in that <i>lucky</i>
moment, and all obedient to their <i>lucky</i> leader, all should
end well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought, a provident thought, now struck Fisher; for even he
had some foresight where his favourite passion was
concerned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, in our Barring Out shall we be
starved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the gipsy, &ldquo;not if you trust to
me for food, and if you give me money enough.&nbsp; Silver
won&rsquo;t do for so many; gold is what must cross my
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no gold,&rdquo; said Fisher, &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t know what you mean by &lsquo;so many.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m only talking of number one, you know.&nbsp; I must take
care of that first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, as Fisher thought it was possible that Archer, clever as
he was, might be disappointed in his supplies, he determined to
take secret measures for himself.&nbsp; His Aunt Barbara&rsquo;s
interdiction had shut him out of the confectioner&rsquo;s shop;
but he flattered himself that he could outwit his aunt; he
therefore begged the gipsy to procure him twelve buns by Thursday
morning, and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the
schoolroom.</p>
<p>As Fisher did not produce any money when he made this
proposal, it was at first absolutely rejected; but a bribe at
length conquered his difficulties; and the bribe which Fisher
found himself obliged to give&mdash;for he had no pocket money
left of his own, he being as much <i>restricted</i> in that
article as Archer was <i>indulged</i>&mdash;the bribe that he
found himself obliged to give to quiet the gipsy was half a
crown, which Archer had intrusted to him to buy candles for the
theatre.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought he to himself;
&ldquo;Archer&rsquo;s so careless about money, he will never
think of asking me for the half-crown again; and now he&rsquo;ll
want no candles for the <i>theatre</i>; or, at anyrate, it will
be some time first; and maybe, Aunt Barbara may be got to give me
that much at Christmas; then, if the worst comes to the worst,
one can pay Archer.&nbsp; My mouth waters for the buns, and have
&rsquo;em I must now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, for the hope of twelve buns, he sacrificed the money which
had been intrusted to him.&nbsp; Thus the meanest motives, in
mean minds often prompt to the commission of those great faults,
to which one should think nothing but some violent passion could
have tempted.</p>
<p>The ambassador having thus, in his opinion, concluded his own
and the public business, returned well satisfied with the result,
after receiving the gipsy&rsquo;s reiterated promise to tap
<i>three times</i> at the window on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The day appointed for the Barring Out at length arrived; and
Archer, assembling the confederates, informed them, that all was
prepared for carrying their design into execution; that he now
depended for success upon their punctuality and courage.&nbsp; He
had, within the last two hours, got all their bars ready to
fasten the doors and window shutters of the schoolroom; he had,
with the assistance of two of the day scholars who were of the
party, sent into the town for provisions, at his own expense,
which would make a handsome supper for that night; he had also
negotiated with some cousins of his, who lived in the town, for a
constant supply in future.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo;
exclaimed Archer, suddenly stopping in this narration of his
services, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one thing, after all, I&rsquo;ve
forgot, we shall be undone without it.&nbsp; Fisher, pray did you
ever buy the candles for the playhouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to be sure,&rdquo; replied Fisher, extremely
frightened; &ldquo;you know you don&rsquo;t want candles for the
playhouse now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the playhouse, but for the Barring Out.&nbsp;
We shall be in the dark, man.&nbsp; You must run this minute,
run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For candles?&rdquo; said Fisher, confused; &ldquo;how
many?&mdash;what sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupidity!&rdquo; exclaimed Archer, &ldquo;you are a
pretty fellow at a dead lift!&nbsp; Lend me a pencil and a bit of
paper, do; I&rsquo;ll write down what I want myself!&nbsp; Well,
what are you fumbling for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For money!&rdquo; said Fisher, colouring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money, man!&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I give you half a crown
the other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fisher, stammering; &ldquo;but I
wasn&rsquo;t sure that that might be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough! yes, to be sure it will.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what you are <i>at</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; said Fisher, &ldquo;here,
write upon this, then,&rdquo; said Fisher, putting a piece of
paper into Archer&rsquo;s hand, upon which Archer wrote his
orders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Away, away!&rdquo; cried he.</p>
<p>Away went Fisher.&nbsp; He returned; but not until a
considerable time afterwards.&nbsp; They were at supper when he
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fisher always comes in at
supper-time,&rdquo; observed one of the Greybeards,
carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and would you have him come in <i>after</i>
supper-time?&rdquo; said Townsend, who always supplied his party
with ready <i>wit</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the candles,&rdquo; whispered Fisher as
he passed by Archer to his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the tinder-box?&rdquo; said Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I got back from my Aunt Barbara under pretence
that I must study for repetition day an hour later
to-night.&nbsp; So I got leave.&nbsp; Was not that
clever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by <i>sober
lies</i>.&nbsp; How Mr. Fisher procured the candles and the
tinder box without money, and without credit, we shall discover
further on.</p>
<p>Archer and his associates had agreed to stay the last in the
schoolroom; and as soon as the Greybeards were gone out to bed,
he, as the signal, was to shut and lock one door, Townsend the
other.&nbsp; A third conspirator was to strike a light, in case
they should not be able to secure a candle.&nbsp; A fourth was to
take charge of the candle as soon as lighted; and all the rest
were to run to their bars, which were secreted in a room; then to
fix them to the common fastening bars of the window, in the
manner in which they had been previously instructed by the
manager.&nbsp; Thus each had his part assigned, and each was
warned that the success of the whole depended upon their order
and punctuality.</p>
<p>Order and punctuality, it appears, are necessary even in a
Barring Out; and even rebellion must have its laws.</p>
<p>The long expected moment at length arrived.&nbsp; De Grey and
his friends, unconscious of what was going forward, walked out of
the schoolroom as usual at bedtime.&nbsp; The clock began to
strike nine.&nbsp; There was one Greybeard left in the room, who
was packing up some of his books, which had been left about by
accident.&nbsp; It is impossible to describe the impatience with
which he was watched, especially by Fisher, and the nine who
depended upon the gipsy oracle.</p>
<p>When he had got all his books together under his arm, he let
one of them fall; and whilst he stooped to pick it up, Archer
gave the signal.&nbsp; The doors were shut, locked, and
double-locked in an instant.&nbsp; A light was struck and each
ran to his post.&nbsp; The bars were all in the same moment put
up to the windows, and Archer, when he had tried them all, and
seen that they were secure, gave a loud
&ldquo;Huzza!&rdquo;&mdash;in which he was joined by all the
party most manfully&mdash;by all but the poor Greybeard, who, the
picture of astonishment, stood stock still in the midst of them
with his books under his arm; at which spectacle Townsend, who
enjoyed the <i>frolic</i> of the fray more than anything else,
burst into an immoderate fit of laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;So, my
little Greybeard,&rdquo; said he, holding a candle full in his
eyes, &ldquo;what think you of all this?&mdash;How came you
amongst the wicked ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, indeed,&rdquo; said the little boy,
very gravely: &ldquo;you shut me up amongst you.&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t you let me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you out!&nbsp; No, no, my little Greybeard,&rdquo;
said Archer, catching hold of him, and dragging him to the window
bars.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look ye here&mdash;touch these&mdash;put your
hand to them&mdash;pull, push, kick&mdash;put a little spirit
into it, man&mdash;kick like an Archer, if you can; away with
ye.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity that the king of the Greybeards is
not here to admire me.&nbsp; I should like to show him our
fortifications.&nbsp; But come, my merry men all, now to the
feast.&nbsp; Out with the table into the middle of the
room.&nbsp; Good cheer, my jolly Archers!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your
manager!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Townsend, delighted with the bustle, rubbed his hands, and
capered about the room, whilst the preparations for the feast
were hurried forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Four candles!&mdash;Four
candles on the table.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have things in style when
we are about it, Mr. Manager,&rdquo; cried Townsend.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Places!&mdash;Places!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing like a
fair scramble, my boys.&nbsp; Let everyone take care of
himself.&nbsp; Hallo! Greybeard, I&rsquo;ve knocked Greybeard
down here in the scuffle.&nbsp; Get up again, my lad, and see a
little life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Fisher, &ldquo;he
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <i>sup</i> with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the manager, &ldquo;he
shan&rsquo;t <i>live</i> with us; a Greybeard is not fit company
for Archers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Townsend, &ldquo;evil
communication corrupts good manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So with one unanimous hiss they hunted the poor little gentle
boy into a corner; and having pent him up with benches, Fisher
opened his books for him, which he thought the greatest
mortification, and set up a candle beside him&mdash;&ldquo;There,
now he looks like a Greybeard as he is!&rdquo; cried they.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s the Latin for cold roast beef?&rdquo;
said Fisher, exultingly, and they returned to their feast.</p>
<p>Long and loud they revelled.&nbsp; They had a few bottles of
cider.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me the corkscrew, the cider
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be kept till it&rsquo;s sour,&rdquo; cried
Townsend, in answer to the manager, who, when he beheld the
provisions vanishing with surprising rapidity, began to fear for
the morrow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hang to-morrow!&rdquo; cried Townsend,
&ldquo;let Greybeards think of to-morrow; Mr. Manager,
here&rsquo;s your good health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archers all stood up as their cups were filled to drink
the health of their chief with a universal cheer.&nbsp; But at
the moment that the cups were at their lips, and as Archer bowed
to thank the company, a sudden shower from above astonished the
whole assembly.&nbsp; They looked up, and beheld the rose of a
watering-engine, whose long neck appeared through a trap door in
the ceiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your good health, Mr. Manager!&rdquo;
said a voice, which was known to be the gardener&rsquo;s; and in
the midst of their surprise and dismay the candles were suddenly
extinguished; the trap-door shut down; and they were left in
utter darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Devil</i>!&rdquo; said Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t swear, Mr. Manager,&rdquo; said the same
voice from the ceiling, &ldquo;I hear every word you
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy upon us!&rdquo; exclaimed Fisher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The clock,&rdquo; added he, whispering, &ldquo;must have
been wrong, for it had not done striking when we began.&nbsp;
Only, you remember, Archer, it had just done before you had done
locking your door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, blockhead!&rdquo; said Archer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, boys! were ye never in the dark before?&nbsp; You
are not afraid of a shower of rain, I hope.&nbsp; Is anybody
drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said they, with a faint laugh, &ldquo;but
what shall we do here in the dark all night long, and all day
to-morrow?&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t unbar the shutters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder <i>nobody</i> ever thought of the
trap-door!&rdquo; said Townsend.</p>
<p>The trap-door had indeed escaped the manager&rsquo;s
observation.&nbsp; As the house was new to him, and the ceiling
being newly white-washed, the opening was scarcely
perceptible.&nbsp; Vexed to be out-generalled, and still more
vexed to have it remarked, Archer poured forth a volley of
incoherent exclamations and reproaches against those who were
thus so soon discouraged by a trifle; and groping for the
tinder-box, he asked if anything could be easier than to strike a
light again. <a name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262"
class="citation">[262]</a>&nbsp; The light appeared.&nbsp; But at
the moment that it made the tinder-box visible, another shower
from above, aimed, and aimed exactly, at the tinder-box, drenched
it with water, and rendered it totally unfit for further
service.&nbsp; Archer in a fury dashed it to the ground.&nbsp;
And now for the first time he felt what it was to be the
unsuccessful head of a party.&nbsp; He heard in his turn the
murmurs of a discontented, changeable populace; and recollecting
all his bars and bolts, and ingenious contrivances, he was more
provoked at their blaming him for this one only oversight than he
was grieved at the disaster itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my hair is all wet!&rdquo; cried one,
dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wring it, then,&rdquo; said Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hand&rsquo;s cut with your broken glass,&rdquo;
cried another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glass!&rdquo; cried a third; &ldquo;mercy! is there
broken glass? and it&rsquo;s all about, I suppose, amongst the
supper; and I had but one bit of bread all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bread!&rdquo; cried Archer; &ldquo;eat if you want
it.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a piece here, and no glass near
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all wet, and I don&rsquo;t like dry bread by
itself; that&rsquo;s no feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh-day!&nbsp; What, nothing but moaning and
grumbling!&nbsp; If these are the joys of a <i>Barring
Out</i>,&rdquo; cried Townsend, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be snug
in my bed.&nbsp; I expected that we should have sat up till
twelve o&rsquo;clock, talking, and laughing, and
singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you may still; what hinders you?&rdquo; said
Archer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sing, and we&rsquo;ll join you, and I should
be glad those fellows overhead heard us singing.&nbsp; Begin,
Townsend&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Come now, all ye social
Powers,<br />
Spread your influence o&rsquo;er us&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Or else&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules
the waves!<br />
Britons never will be slaves.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment.&nbsp; In
vain they roared in chorus.&nbsp; In vain they tried to appear
gay.&nbsp; It would not do.&nbsp; The voices died away, and
dropped off one by one.&nbsp; They had each provided himself with
a great-coat to sleep upon; but now, in the dark, there was a
peevish scrambling contest for the coats, and half the company,
in very bad humour, stretched themselves upon the benches for the
night.</p>
<p>There is great pleasure in bearing anything that has the
appearance of hardship as long as there is any glory to be
acquired by it: but when people feel themselves foiled, there is
no further pleasure in endurance; and if, in their misfortune,
there is any mixture of the ridiculous, the motives for heroism
are immediately destroyed.&nbsp; Dr. Middleton had probably
considered this in the choice he made of his first attack.</p>
<p>Archer, who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of
government upon his shoulders, rose early in the morning, whilst
everybody else was fast asleep.&nbsp; In the night he had
resolved the affair of the trap-door, and a new danger had
alarmed him.&nbsp; It was possible that the enemy might descend
upon them through the trap-door.&nbsp; The room had been built
high to admit a free circulation of air.&nbsp; It was twenty
feet, so that it was in vain to think of reaching to the
trap-door.</p>
<p>As soon as the daylight appeared, Archer rose softly, that he
might <i>reconnoitre</i>, and devise some method of guarding
against this new danger.&nbsp; Luckily there were round holes in
the top of the window-shutters, which admitted sufficient light
for him to work by.&nbsp; The remains of the soaked feast, wet
candles, and broken glass spread over the table in the middle of
the room, looked rather dismal this morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty set of fellows I have to manage!&rdquo; said
Archer, contemplating the group of sleepers before him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is well they have somebody to think for them.&nbsp; Now
if I wanted&mdash;which, thank goodness, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;but
if I did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance, whom
could I pitch upon? not this stupid snorer, who is dreaming of
gipsies, if he is dreaming of anything,&rdquo; continued Archer,
as he looked into Fisher&rsquo;s open mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
next chap is quick enough; but, then, he is so fond of having
everything his own way.&nbsp; And this curl pated monkey, who is
grinning in his sleep, is all tongue and no brains.&nbsp; Here
are brains, though nobody would think it, in this lump,&rdquo;
said he, looking at a fat, rolled up, heavy breathing sleeper;
&ldquo;but what signify brains to such a lazy dog?&nbsp; I might
kick him for my football this half hour before I should get him
awake.&nbsp; This lank jawed harlequin beside him is a handy
fellow, to be sure; but, then, if he has hands, he has no
head&mdash;and he&rsquo;d be afraid of his own shadow too, by
this light, he is such a coward!&nbsp; And Townsend, why, he has
puns in plenty; but, when there&rsquo;s any work to be done,
he&rsquo;s the worst fellow to be near one in the world&mdash;he
can do nothing but laugh at his own puns.&nbsp; This poor little
fellow that we hunted into the corner has more sense than all of
them put together; but then he is a Greybeard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping
friends.&nbsp; And how did it happen that he should be so
ambitious to please and govern this set, when, for each
individual of which it was composed, he felt such supreme
contempt?&nbsp; He had formed them into a <i>party</i>, had given
them a name, and he was at their head.&nbsp; If these be not good
reasons, none better can be assigned for Archer&rsquo;s
conduct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish ye could all sleep on,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;but I must waken ye, though you will be only in my
way.&nbsp; The sound of my hammering must waken them; so I may as
well do the thing handsomely, and flatter some of them by
pretending to ask their advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, he pulled two or three to waken them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, Townsend, waken, my boy!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s some
diversion for you&mdash;up! up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diversion!&rdquo; cried Townsend; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your
man!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m up&mdash;<i>up to anything</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, under the name of <i>diversion</i>, Archer set Townsend to
work at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; They had nails,
a few tools, and several spars, still left from the wreck of the
playhouse.&nbsp; These, by Archer&rsquo;s directions, they
sharpened at one end, and nailed them to the ends of several
forms.</p>
<p>All hands were now called to clear away the supper things, to
erect these forms perpendicularly under the trap-door; and with
the assistance of a few braces, a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> was
formed, upon which nobody could venture to descend.&nbsp; At the
farthest end of the room they likewise formed a penthouse of the
tables, under which they proposed to breakfast, secure from the
pelting storm, if it should again assail them through the
trap-door.&nbsp; They crowded under the penthouse as soon as it
was ready, and their admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen
for the job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! I shall like to see the gardener&rsquo;s phiz
through the trap-door, when he beholds the spikes under
him!&rdquo; cried Townsend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now for
breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, now for breakfast,&rdquo; said Archer, looking at
his watch; &ldquo;past eight o&rsquo;clock, and my town boys not
come!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archer had expected a constant supply of provisions from two
boys who lived in the town, who were cousins of his, and who had
promised to come every day, and put food in at a certain hole in
the wall, in which a ventilator usually turned.&nbsp; This
ventilator Archer had taken down, and had contrived it so that it
could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure; but, upon
examination, it was now perceived that the hole had been newly
stopped up by an iron back, which it was impossible to penetrate
or remove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never came into my head that anybody would ever have
thought of the ventilator but myself!&rdquo; exclaimed Archer, in
great perplexity.&nbsp; He listened and waited for his cousins;
but no cousins came, and at a late hour the company were obliged
to breakfast upon the scattered fragments of the last
night&rsquo;s feast.&nbsp; That feast had been spread with such
imprudent profusion, that little now remained to satisfy the
hungry guests.</p>
<p>Archer, who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a
scarcity would have upon his associates, did everything that
could be done by a bold countenance and reiterated assertions to
persuade them that his cousins would certainly come at last and
that the supplies were only delayed.&nbsp; The delay, however,
was alarming.</p>
<p>Fisher alone heard the manager&rsquo;s calculations and saw
the public fears unmoved.&nbsp; Secretly rejoicing in his own
wisdom, he walked from window to window, slily listening for the
gipsy&rsquo;s signal.&nbsp; &ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; cried he
with more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened
them before.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come this way, Archer; but don&rsquo;t
tell anybody.&nbsp; Hark! do ye hear those three taps at the
window?&nbsp; This is the old woman with twelve buns for
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you one whole one for yourself, if you
will unbar the window for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbar the window!&rdquo; interrupted Archer; &ldquo;no,
that I won&rsquo;t, for you or the gipsy either; but I have heard
enough to get your buns without that.&nbsp; But stay; there is
something of more consequence than your twelve buns.&nbsp; I must
think for ye all, I see, regularly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he summoned a council, and proposed that everyone should
subscribe, and trust the subscription to the gipsy, to purchase a
fresh supply of provisions.&nbsp; Archer laid down a guinea of
his own money for his subscription; at which sight all the
company clapped their hands, and his popularity rose to a high
pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty.&nbsp; Now, having made
a list of their wants, they folded the money in the paper, put it
into a bag, which Archer tied to a long string, and, having
broken the pane of glass behind the round hole in the
window-shutter, he let down the bag to the gipsy.&nbsp; She
promised to be punctual, and having filled the bag with
Fisher&rsquo;s twelve buns, they were drawn up in triumph, and
everybody anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the
same bag drawn up at dinner-time.&nbsp; The buns were a little
squeezed in being drawn through the hole in the window-shutter;
but Archer immediately sawed out a piece of the shutter, and
broke the corresponding panes in each of the other windows, to
prevent suspicion, and to make it appear that they had all been
broken to admit air.</p>
<p>What a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed
to no purpose!</p>
<p>It may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gipsy
was so punctual to her promise to Fisher, but we must recollect
that her apparent integrity was only cunning; she was punctual
that she might be employed again, that she might be intrusted
with the contribution which, she foresaw, must be raised amongst
the famishing garrison.&nbsp; No sooner had she received the
money than her end was gained.</p>
<p>Dinner-time came; it struck three, four, five, six.&nbsp; They
listened with hungry ears, but no signal was heard.&nbsp; The
morning had been very long, and Archer had in vain tried to
dissuade them from devouring the remainder of the provisions
before they were sure of a fresh supply.&nbsp; And now those who
had been the most confident were the most impatient of their
disappointment.</p>
<p>Archer, in the division of the food, had attempted, by the
most scrupulous exactness, to content the public, and he was both
astonished and provoked to perceive that his impartiality was
impeached.&nbsp; So differently do people judge in different
situations!&nbsp; He was the first person to accuse his master of
injustice, and the least capable of bearing such an imputation
upon himself from others.&nbsp; He now experienced some of the
joys of power, and the delight of managing unreasonable
numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have not I done everything I could to please you?&nbsp;
Have not I spent my money to buy you food?&nbsp; Have not I
divided the last morsel with you?&nbsp; I have not tasted one
mouthful to-day!&nbsp; Did not I set to work for you at
sunrise?&nbsp; Did not I lie awake all night for you?&nbsp; Have
not I had all the labour, and all the anxiety?&nbsp; Look round
and see <i>my</i> contrivances, <i>my</i> work, <i>my</i>
generosity!&nbsp; And, after all, you think me a tyrant, because
I want you to have common sense.&nbsp; Is not this bun which I
hold in my hand my own?&nbsp; Did not I earn it by my own
ingenuity from that selfish dunce&rdquo; (pointing to Fisher),
&ldquo;who could never have gotten one of his twelve buns, if I
had not shown him how?&nbsp; Eleven of them he has eaten since
morning for his own share, without offering anyone a morsel; but
I scorn to eat even what is justly my own, when I see so many
hungry creatures longing for it.&nbsp; I was not going to touch
this last morsel myself.&nbsp; I only begged you to keep it till
supper-time, when perhaps you&rsquo;ll want it more, and
Townsend, who can&rsquo;t bear the slightest thing that crosses
his own whims, and who thinks there&rsquo;s nothing in this world
to be minded but his own diversion, calls me a
<i>tyrant</i>.&nbsp; You all of you promised to obey me.&nbsp;
The first thing I ask you to do for your own good, and when, if
you had common sense, you must know I can want nothing but your
good, you rebel against me.&nbsp; Traitors! fools! ungrateful
fools!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archer walked up and down, unable to command his emotion,
whilst, for the moment, the discontented multitude was
silenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, striking his hand upon the little
boy&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the only one amongst
you who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint, and he
has had but one bit of bread&mdash;a bit that I gave him myself
this day.&nbsp; Here!&rdquo; said he, snatching the bun, which
nobody had dared to touch, &ldquo;take it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
mine&mdash;I give it to you, though you are a Greybeard; you
deserve it.&nbsp; Eat it, and be an Archer.&nbsp; You shall be my
captain; will you?&rdquo; said he, lifting him up in his arm
above the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you now,&rdquo; said the little boy,
courageously; &ldquo;but I love De Grey better; he has always
been my friend, and he advised me never to call myself any of
those names, Archer or Greybeard; so I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Though
I am shut in here, I have nothing to do with it.&nbsp; I love Dr.
Middleton; he was never unjust to <i>me</i>, and I daresay that
he has very good reasons, as De Grey said, for forbidding us to
go into that house.&nbsp; Besides, it&rsquo;s his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this
little lad, Archer suffered Townsend to snatch the untasted bun
out of his hands.&nbsp; He flung it at a hole in the window, but
it fell back.&nbsp; The Archers scrambled for it, and Fisher ate
it.</p>
<p>Archer saw this, and was sensible that he had not done
handsomely in suffering it.&nbsp; A few moments ago he had
admired his own generosity, and though he had felt the injustice
of others, he had not accused himself of any.&nbsp; He turned
away from the little boy, and sitting down at one end of the
table, hid his face in his hands.&nbsp; He continued immovable in
this posture for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; said Townsend; &ldquo;it was an excellent
joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Fisher; &ldquo;what a fool, to think
so much about a bun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Mr. Archer, if you are thinking about
me,&rdquo; said the little boy, trying gently to pull his hands
from his face.</p>
<p>Archer stooped down, and lifted him up upon the table, at
which sight the partisans set up a general hiss.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
has forsaken us!&nbsp; He deserts his party!&nbsp; He wants to be
a Greybeard!&nbsp; After he has got us all into this scrape, he
will leave us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to leave you,&rdquo; cried Archer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No one shall ever accuse me of deserting my party.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll stick by the Archers, right or wrong, I tell you, to
the last moment.&nbsp; But this little fellow&mdash;take it as
you please, mutiny if you will, and throw me out of the
window.&nbsp; Call me traitor! coward! Greybeard!&mdash;this
little fellow is worth you all put together, and I&rsquo;ll stand
by him against anyone who dares to lay a finger upon him; and the
next morsel of food that I see shall be his.&nbsp; Touch him who
dares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commanding air with which Archer spoke and looked, and the
belief that the little boy deserved his protection, silenced the
crowd.&nbsp; But the storm was only hushed.</p>
<p>No sound of merriment was now to be heard&mdash;no battledore
and shuttlecock&mdash;no ball, no marbles.&nbsp; Some sat in a
corner, whispering their wishes that Archer would unbar the
doors, and give up.&nbsp; Others, stretching their arms, and
gaping as they sauntered up and down the room, wished for air, or
food, or water.&nbsp; Fisher and his nine, who had such firm
dependence upon the gipsy, now gave themselves up to utter
despair.&nbsp; It was eight o&rsquo;clock, growing darker and
darker every minute, and no candles, no light could they
have.&nbsp; The prospect of another long dark night made them
still more discontented.</p>
<p>Townsend, at the head of the yawners, and Fisher, at the head
of the hungry malcontents, gathered round Archer and the few yet
unconquered spirits, demanding &ldquo;How long he meant to keep
them in this dark dungeon? and whether he expected that they
should starve themselves for his sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of <i>giving up</i> was more intolerable to Archer
than all the rest.&nbsp; He saw that the majority, his own
convincing argument, was against him.&nbsp; He was therefore
obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion.&nbsp; He
flattered some with hopes of food from the town boys.&nbsp; Some
he reminded of their promises; others he praised for former
prowess; and others he shamed by the repetition of their high
vaunts in the beginning of the business.</p>
<p>It was at length resolved that at all events they <i>would
hold out</i>.&nbsp; With this determination they stretched
themselves again to sleep, for the second night, in weak and
weary obstinacy.</p>
<p>Archer slept longer and more soundly than usual the next
morning, and when he awoke, he found his hands tied behind
him!&nbsp; Three or four boys had just got hold of his feet,
which they pressed down, whilst the trembling hands of Fisher
were fastening the cord round them.</p>
<p>With all the force which rage could inspire, Archer struggled
and roared to &ldquo;<i>his Archers</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;his
friends, his party&mdash;for help against the traitors.&nbsp; But
all kept aloof.&nbsp; Townsend, in particular, stood laughing and
looking on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Archer, but really
you look so droll.&nbsp; All alive and kicking!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
be angry.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so weak, I cannot help laughing
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The packthread cracked.&nbsp; &ldquo;His hands are free!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s loose!&rdquo; cried the least of the boys, and ran
away, whilst Archer leaped up, and seizing hold of Fisher with a
powerful grasp, sternly demanded &ldquo;What he meant by
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask my party,&rdquo; said Fisher, terrified;
&ldquo;they set me on; ask my party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your party!&rdquo; cried Archer, with a look of
ineffable contempt; &ldquo;you reptile!&mdash;<i>your</i>
party?&nbsp; Can such a thing as <i>you</i> have a
party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; said Fisher, settling his collar,
which Archer in his surprise had let go; &ldquo;to be sure!&nbsp;
Why not?&nbsp; Any man who chooses it may have a party as well as
yourself, I suppose.&nbsp; I have nine Fishermen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, spoken with much sullen importance, Archer, in
spite of his vexation, could not help laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fishermen!&rdquo; cried he,
&ldquo;<i>Fishermen</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not Fishermen as well as Archers?&rdquo; cried
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;One party is just as good as another; it is
only a question which can get the upper hand; and we had your
hands tied just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Townsend,&rdquo; said Archer,
&ldquo;laugh on, my boy!&nbsp; Friend or foe, it&rsquo;s all the
same to you.&nbsp; I know how to value your friendship now.&nbsp;
You are a mighty good fellow when the sun shines; but let a storm
come, and how you slink away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant, Archer felt the difference between <i>a good
companion</i> and a good friend, a difference which some people
do not discover till late in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I no friend?&mdash;no real friend amongst you
all?&nbsp; And could ye stand by, and see my hands tied behind me
like a thief&rsquo;s?&nbsp; What signifies such a party&mdash;all
mute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want something to eat,&rdquo; answered the
Fishermen.&nbsp; &ldquo;What signifies <i>such</i> a party,
indeed? and <i>such</i> a manager, who can do nothing for
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have <i>I</i> done nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s hear any more prosing,&rdquo;
said Fisher; &ldquo;we are too many for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
advised my party, if they&rsquo;ve a mind not to be starved, to
give you up for the ringleader, as you were; and Dr. Middleton
will not let us all off, I daresay.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, depending
upon the sullen silence of the assembly, he again approached
Archer with a cord.&nbsp; A cry of &ldquo;No, no, no! Don&rsquo;t
tie him,&rdquo; was feebly raised.</p>
<p>Archer stood still, but the moment Fisher touched him he
knocked him down to the ground, and turning to the rest, with
eyes sparkling with indignation, &ldquo;Archers!&rdquo; cried
he.&nbsp; A voice at this instant was heard at the door.&nbsp; It
was De Grey&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have got a large basket
of provisions for your breakfast.&rdquo;&nbsp; A general shout of
joy was sent forth by the voracious public.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Breakfast!&nbsp; Provisions!&nbsp; A large basket!&nbsp;
De Grey for ever!&nbsp; Huzza!&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Grey promised, upon his honour, that if he would unbar the
door nobody should come in with him, and no advantage should be
taken of them.&nbsp; This promise was enough even for
Archer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will let him in,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;myself; for I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll never break his
word.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pulled away the bar; the door opened, and
having bargained for the liberty of Melson, the little boy, who
had been shut in by mistake, De Grey entered with his basket of
provisions, when he locked and barred the door instantly.</p>
<p>Joy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his
basket, and spread the table with a plentiful breakfast.&nbsp; A
hundred questions were asked him at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eat
first,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we will talk
afterwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; This business was quickly despatched by
those who had not tasted food for a long while.&nbsp; Their
curiosity increased as their hunger diminished.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
sent us breakfast?&nbsp; Does Dr. Middleton know?&rdquo; were
questions reiterated from every mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does know,&rdquo; answered De Grey; &ldquo;and the
first thing I have to tell you is, that I am your
fellow-prisoner.&nbsp; I am to stay here till you give up.&nbsp;
This was the only condition on which Dr. Middleton would allow me
to bring you food, and he will allow no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone looked at the empty basket.&nbsp; But Archer, in whom
half vanquished party spirit revived with the strength he had got
from his breakfast, broke into exclamations in praise of De
Grey&rsquo;s magnanimity, as he now imagined that De Grey had
become one of themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will join us, will you?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a
noble fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered De Grey, calmly; &ldquo;but I hope
to persuade, or rather to convince you, that you ought to join
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have found it no hard task to have persuaded
or convinced us, whichever you pleased,&rdquo; said Townsend,
&ldquo;if you had appealed to Archers fasting; but Archers
feasting are quite other animals.&nbsp; Even C&aelig;sar himself,
after breakfast, is quite another thing!&rdquo; added he,
pointing to Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may speak for yourself, Mr. Townsend,&rdquo;
replied the insulted hero, &ldquo;but not for me, or for Archers
in general, if you please.&nbsp; We unbarred the door upon the
faith of De Grey&rsquo;s promise&mdash;<i>that</i> was not giving
up.&nbsp; And it would have been just as difficult, I promise
you, to persuade or convince me either that I should give up
against my honour before breakfast as after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This spirited speech was applauded by many, who had now
forgotten the feelings of famine.&nbsp; Not so Fisher, whose
memory was upon this occasion very distinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense,&rdquo; and the orator paused for a
synonymous expression, but none was at hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
nonsense and&mdash;nonsense is here!&nbsp; Why, don&rsquo;t you
remember that dinner-time, and supper-time and breakfast-time
will come again?&nbsp; So what signifies mouthing about
persuading and convincing?&nbsp; We will not go through again
what we did yesterday!&nbsp; Honour me no honour.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t understand it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be flogged at
once, as I have been many&rsquo;s the good time for a less
thing.&nbsp; I say, we&rsquo;d better all be flogged at once,
which must be the end of it sooner or later, than wait here to be
without dinner, breakfast, and supper, all only because Mr.
Archer won&rsquo;t give up because of his honour and
nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many prudent faces amongst the Fishermen seemed to deliberate
at the close of this oration, in which the arguments were brought
so &ldquo;home to each man&rsquo;s business and bosom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said De Grey, &ldquo;when we yield, I hope
it will not be merely to get our dinner, gentlemen.&nbsp; When we
yield, Archer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t address yourself to me,&rdquo; interrupted
Archer, struggling with his pride; &ldquo;you have no further
occasion to try to win me.&nbsp; I have no power, no party, you
see!&nbsp; And now I find that I have no friends, I don&rsquo;t
care what becomes of myself.&nbsp; I suppose I&rsquo;m to be
given up as a ringleader.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s this Fisher, and a
party of his Fishermen, were going to tie me hand and foot, if I
had not knocked him down, just as you came to the door, De Grey;
and now perhaps you will join Fisher&rsquo;s party against
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of
joining any party, when a sudden change appeared on
Archer&rsquo;s countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried
Archer, in an imperious tone, and there was silence.&nbsp;
Someone was heard to whistle the beginning of a tune, that was
perfectly new to everybody present, except to Archer, who
immediately whistled the conclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;There!&rdquo;
cried he, looking at De Grey, with triumph; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner, which
I learned from &lsquo;Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
know how to make use of everything.&nbsp; Hallo! friend! are you
there at last?&rdquo; cried he, going to the ventilator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we are barred out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round to the window then, and fill our bag.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll let it down, my lad, in a trice; bar me out who
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archer let down the bag with all the expedition of joy, and it
was filled with all the expedition of fear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pull
away! make haste, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; said the voice
from without; &ldquo;the gardener will come from dinner, else,
and we shall be caught.&nbsp; He mounted guard all yesterday at
the ventilator; and though I watched and watched till it was
darker than pitch, I could not get near you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what has taken him out of the way now.&nbsp; Make haste,
pull away!&rdquo;&nbsp; The heavy bag was soon pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any more?&rdquo; said Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, plenty.&nbsp; Let down quick!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got
the tailor&rsquo;s bag full, which is three times as large as
yours, and I&rsquo;ve changed clothes with the tailor&rsquo;s
boy; so nobody took notice of me as I came down the
street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my own cousin!&rdquo; exclaimed Archer,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a noble fellow! there&rsquo;s my own cousin,
I acknowledge.&nbsp; Fill the bag, then.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several
times the bag descended and ascended; and at every unlading of
the crane, fresh acclamations were heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no more!&rdquo; at length the boy with the
tailor&rsquo;s bag cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off with you, then; we&rsquo;ve enough, and thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A delightful review was now made of their treasure.&nbsp; Busy
hands arranged and sorted the heterogeneous mass.&nbsp; Archer,
in the height of his glory, looked on, the acknowledged master of
the whole.&nbsp; Townsend, who, in his prosperity as in
adversity, saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his friends,
pushed De Grey, who was looking on with a more good-natured and
more thoughtful air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you look like a great philosopher, and Archer a great
hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Townsend,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;may look
like a wit, if you will; but you will never be a hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Townsend; &ldquo;wits were never
heroes, because they are wits.&nbsp; You are out of your wits,
and therefore may set up for a hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh, and welcome.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a tyrant.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t want to restrain anybody&rsquo;s wit; but I cannot
say I admire puns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, either,&rdquo; said the time serving Fisher,
sidling up to the manager, and picking the ice off a piece of
plum-cake, &ldquo;nor I either; I hate puns.&nbsp; I can never
understand Townsend&rsquo;s <i>puns</i>.&nbsp; Besides, anybody
can make puns; and one doesn&rsquo;t want wit, either, at all
times; for instance, when one is going to settle about dinner, or
business of consequence.&nbsp; Bless us all, Archer!&rdquo;
continued he, with sudden familiarity; &ldquo;<i>what a sight of
good things are here</i>!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure we are much
obliged to you and your cousin.&nbsp; I never thought he&rsquo;d
have come.&nbsp; Why, now we can hold out as long as you
please.&nbsp; Let us see,&rdquo; said he, dividing the provisions
upon the table; &ldquo;we can hold out to-day, and all to-morrow,
and part of next day, maybe.&nbsp; Why, now we may defy the
doctor and the Greybeards.&nbsp; The doctor will surely give up
to us; for, you see, he knows nothing of all this, and
he&rsquo;ll think we are starving all this while; and he&rsquo;d
be afraid, you see, to let us starve quite, in reality, for three
whole days, because of what would be said in the town.&nbsp; My
Aunt Barbara, for one, would be <i>at him</i> long before that
time was out; and besides, you know, in that case, he&rsquo;d be
hanged for murder, which is quite another thing, in law, from a
<i>Barring Out</i>, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archer had not given to this harangue all the attention which
it deserved, for his eye was fixed upon De Grey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is De Grey thinking of?&rdquo; he asked,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; said De Grey, &ldquo;that Dr.
Middleton must believe that I have betrayed his confidence in
me.&nbsp; The gardener was ordered away from his watch-post for
one half-hour when I was admitted.&nbsp; This half-hour the
gardener has made nearly a hour.&nbsp; I never would have come
near you if I had foreseen all this.&nbsp; Dr. Middleton trusted
me, and now he will repent of his confidence in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Grey!&rdquo; cried Archer, with energy, &ldquo;he
shall not repent of his confidence in you&mdash;nor shall you
repent of coming amongst us. You shall find that we have some
honour as well as yourself, and I will take care of your honour
as if it were my <i>own</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey-day!&rdquo; interrupted Townsend; &ldquo;are heroes
allowed to change sides, pray?&nbsp; And does the chief of the
Archers stand talking sentiment to the chief of the
Greybeards?&nbsp; In the middle of his own party too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Party!&rdquo; repeated Archer, disdainfully; &ldquo;I
have done with parties!&nbsp; I see what parties are made
of!&nbsp; I have felt the want of a friend, and I am determined
to make one if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you may do,&rdquo; said De Grey, stretching out
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unbar the doors! unbar the windows!&rdquo; exclaimed
Archer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Away with all these things!&nbsp; I give up
for De Grey&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He shall not lose his credit on
my account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said De Grey, &ldquo;you shall not give up
for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll give up to do what is
<i>honourable</i>,&rdquo; said Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not to do what is <i>reasonable</i>?&rdquo; said De
Grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Reasonable</i>!&nbsp; Oh, the first thing that a man
of spirit should think of is, what is
<i>honourable</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will he find out <i>what is</i> honourable,
unless he can reason?&rdquo; replied De Grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;his own feelings always
tell him what is honourable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have not <i>your feelings</i>,&rdquo; asked De Grey,
&ldquo;changed within these few hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with circumstances,&rdquo; replied Archer;
&ldquo;but right or wrong, as long as I think it honourable to do
so and so, I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot think anything honourable, or the
contrary,&rdquo; observed De Grey, &ldquo;without reasoning; and
as to what you call feeling, it&rsquo;s only a quick sort of
reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quicker, the better,&rdquo; said Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said De Grey.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
apt to reason best when we are not in quite so great a
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;we have not always time
enough to reason <i>at first</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must, however, acknowledge,&rdquo; replied De Grey,
smiling, &ldquo;that no man but a fool thinks it honourable to be
in the wrong <i>at last</i>.&nbsp; Is it not, therefore, best to
begin by reasoning to find out the right <i>at
first</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you reason with yourself at first?&nbsp; And
did you find out that it was right to bar Dr. Middleton out of
his own schoolroom, because he desired you not to go into one of
his own houses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Archer; &ldquo;but I should never
have thought of heading a Barring Out, if he had not shown
partiality; and if you had flown into a passion with me openly at
once for pulling down your scenery, which would have been quite
natural, and not have gone slily and forbid us the house out of
revenge, there would have been none of this work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said De Grey, &ldquo;should you suspect me
of such a mean action, when you have never seen or known me do
anything mean, and when in this instance you have no
proofs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me your word and honour now, De Grey,
before everybody here, that you did not do what I
suspected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do assure you, upon my honour, I never, indirectly,
spoke to Dr. Middleton about the playhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as glad as
if I had found a thousand pounds!&nbsp; Now you are my friend
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Dr. Middleton&mdash;why should you suspect him
without reason any more than me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;he is your
friend, and you are right to defend him; and I won&rsquo;t say
another word against him.&nbsp; Will that satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite!&nbsp; Then, indeed you are
unreasonable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied De Grey; &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t
wish you to yield out of friendship to me, any more than to
honour.&nbsp; If you yield to reason, you will be governed by
reason another time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; but then don&rsquo;t triumph over me, because you
have the best side of the argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&nbsp; How can I?&rdquo; said De Grey; &ldquo;for
now you are on <i>the best side</i> as well as myself, are not
you?&nbsp; So we may triumph together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good friend!&rdquo; said Archer; and with
great eagerness he pulled down the fortifications, whilst every
hand assisted.&nbsp; The room was restored to order in a few
minutes&mdash;the shutters were thrown open, the cheerful light
let in.&nbsp; The windows were thrown up, and the first feeling
of the fresh air was delightful.&nbsp; The green playgound opened
before them, and the hopes of exercise and liberty brightened the
countenances of these voluntary prisoners.</p>
<p>But, alas! they were not yet at liberty.&nbsp; The idea of Dr.
Middleton, and the dread of his vengeance, smote their
hearts.&nbsp; When the rebels had sent an ambassador with their
surrender, they stood in pale and silent suspense, waiting for
their doom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Fisher, looking up at the broken panes
in the windows, &ldquo;the doctor will think the most of
<i>that</i>&mdash;he&rsquo;ll never forgive us for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! here he comes!&rdquo;&nbsp; His steady step was
heard approaching nearer and nearer.&nbsp; Archer threw open the
door, and Dr. Middleton entered.&nbsp; Fisher instantly fell on
his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no delight to me to see people on their
knees.&nbsp; Stand up, Mr. Fisher.&nbsp; I hope you are all
conscious that you have done wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;they are conscious that
they have done wrong, and so am I.&nbsp; I am the
ringleader.&nbsp; Punish me as you think proper.&nbsp; I
submit.&nbsp; Your punishments&mdash;your vengeance ought to fall
on me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Middleton, calmly, &ldquo;I
perceive that whatever else you may have learned in the course of
your education, you have not been taught the meaning of the word
punishment.&nbsp; Punishment and vengeance do not with us mean
the same thing.&nbsp; <i>Punishment</i> is pain given, with the
reasonable hope of preventing those on whom it is inflicted from
doing, <i>in future</i>, what will hurt themselves or
others.&nbsp; <i>Vengeance</i> never looks to the <i>future</i>,
but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past.&nbsp;
I feel no anger; you have done me no injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here many of the little boys looked timidly up to the
windows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I see that you have broken my windows;
that is a small evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&nbsp; How good!&nbsp; How merciful!&rdquo;
exclaimed those who had been most panic-struck.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
forgives us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; resumed Dr. Middleton; &ldquo;I cannot
forgive you.&nbsp; I shall never revenge, but it is my duty to
punish.&nbsp; You have rebelled against the just authority which
is necessary to conduct and govern you whilst you have not
sufficient reason to govern and conduct yourselves.&nbsp; Without
obedience to the laws,&rdquo; added he, turning to Archer,
&ldquo;as men, you cannot be suffered in society.&nbsp; You, sir,
think yourself a man, I observe; and you think it the part of a
man not to submit to the will of another.&nbsp; I have no
pleasure in making others, whether men or children, submit to my
<i>will</i>; but my reason and experience are superior to
yours.&nbsp; Your parents at least think so, or they would not
have intrusted me with the care of your education.&nbsp; As long
as they do intrust you to my care, and as long as I have any
hopes of making you wiser and better by punishment, I shall
steadily inflict it, whenever I judge it to be necessary, and I
judge it to be necessary <i>now</i>.&nbsp; This is a long sermon,
Mr. Archer, not preached to show my own eloquence, but to
convince your understanding.&nbsp; Now, as to your
punishment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it, sir,&rdquo; said Archer; &ldquo;whatever it
is, I will cheerfully submit to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it yourself,&rdquo; said Dr. Middleton, &ldquo;and
show me that you now understand the nature of
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archer, proud to be treated like a reasonable creature, and
sorry that he had behaved like a foolish schoolboy, was silent
for some time, but at length replied, &ldquo;That he would rather
not name his own punishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; He repeated, however,
that he trusted he should bear it well, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall, then,&rdquo; said Dr. Middleton,
&ldquo;deprive you, for two months, of pocket-money, as you have
had too much, and have made a bad use of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;I brought five guineas
with me to school.&nbsp; This guinea is all that I have
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Middleton received the guinea which Archer offered him
with a look of approbation, and told him that it should be
applied to the repairs of the schoolroom.&nbsp; The rest of the
boys waited in silence for the doctor&rsquo;s sentence against
them, but not with those looks of abject fear with which boys
usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall return from the playground, all of
you,&rdquo; said Dr. Middleton, &ldquo;one quarter of an hour
sooner, for two months to come, than the rest of your
companions.&nbsp; A bell shall ring at the appointed time.&nbsp;
I give you an opportunity of recovering my confidence by your
punctuality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir! we will come the instant, the very instant the
bell rings; you shall have confidence in us,&rdquo; cried they,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deserve your confidence, I hope,&rdquo; said Dr.
Middleton; &ldquo;for it is my first wish to make you all
happy.&nbsp; You do not know the pain that it has cost me to
deprive you of food for so many hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the boys, with one accord, ran to the place where they
had deposited their last supplies.&nbsp; Archer delivered them up
to the doctor, proud to show that they were not reduced to
obedience merely by necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason,&rdquo; resumed Dr. Middleton, having now
returned to the usual benignity of his manner&mdash;&ldquo;the
reason why I desired that none of you should go to that
building,&rdquo; pointing out of the window, &ldquo;was
this:&mdash;I had been informed that a gang of gipsies had slept
there the night before I spoke to you, one of whom was
dangerously ill of a putrid fever.&nbsp; I did not choose to
mention my reason to you or your friends.&nbsp; I have had the
place cleaned, and you may return to it when you please.&nbsp;
The gipsies were yesterday removed from the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Grey, you were in the right,&rdquo; whispered
Archer, &ldquo;and it was I that was <i>unjust</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old woman,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;whom
you employed to buy food, has escaped the fever, but she has not
escaped a gaol, whither she was sent yesterday, for having
defrauded you of your money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fisher,&rdquo; said Dr. Middleton, &ldquo;as to
you, I shall not punish you; I have no hope of making you either
wiser or better.&nbsp; Do you know this paper?&rdquo;&mdash;the
paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desired him to buy those things, sir,&rdquo; said
Archer, colouring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you desire him not to pay for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Archer, &ldquo;he had half a crown on
purpose to pay for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he had, but he chose to apply it to his private
use, and gave it to the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own
eating.&nbsp; To obtain credit for the tinder-box and candles, he
made use of <i>this</i> name,&rdquo; said he, turning to the
other side of the bill, and pointing to De Grey&rsquo;s name,
which was written at the end of a copy of one of De Grey&rsquo;s
exercises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, sir&mdash;&rdquo; cried Archer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not assure me, sir,&rdquo; said Dr. Middleton;
&ldquo;I cannot suspect a boy of your temper of having any part
in so base an action.&nbsp; When the people in the shop refused
to let Mr. Fisher have the things without paying for them, he
made use of De Grey&rsquo;s name, who was known there.&nbsp;
Suspecting some mischief, however, from the purchase of the
tinder-box, the shopkeeper informed me of the circumstance.&nbsp;
Nothing in this whole business gave me half so much pain as I
felt, for a moment, when I suspected that De Grey was concerned
in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; A loud cry, in which Archer&rsquo;s voice was
heard most distinctly, declared De Grey&rsquo;s innocence.&nbsp;
Dr. Middleton looked round at their eager, honest faces, with
benevolent approbation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Archer,&rdquo; said he,
taking him by the hand, &ldquo;I am heartily glad to see that you
have got the better of your party spirit.&nbsp; I wish you may
keep such a friend as you have now beside you; one such friend is
worth two such parties.&nbsp; As for you, Mr. Fisher, depart; you
must never return hither again.&rdquo;&nbsp; In vain he solicited
Archer and De Grey to intercede for him.&nbsp; Everybody turned
away with contempt; and he sneaked out, whimpering in a doleful
voice, &ldquo;What shall I say to my Aunt Barbara?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>THE
BRACELETS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a beautiful and retired part of
England lived Mrs. Villars, a lady whose accurate understanding,
benevolent heart, and steady temper peculiarly fitted her for the
most difficult, as well as most important, of all
occupations&mdash;the education of youth.&nbsp; This task she had
undertaken; and twenty young persons were put under her care,
with the perfect confidence of their parents.&nbsp; No young
people could be happier; they were good and gay, emulous, but not
envious of each other; for Mrs. Villars was impartially just; her
praise they felt to be the reward of merit, and her blame they
knew to be the necessary consequence of ill-conduct.&nbsp; To the
one, therefore, they patiently submitted, and in the other
consciously rejoiced.&nbsp; They rose with fresh cheerfulness in
the morning, eager to pursue their various occupations.&nbsp;
They returned in the evening with renewed ardour to their
amusements, and retired to rest satisfied with themselves and
pleased with each other.</p>
<p>Nothing so much contributed to preserve a spirit of emulation
in this little society as a small honorary distinction, given
annually, as a prize of successful application.&nbsp; The prize
this year was peculiarly dear to each individual, as it was the
picture of a friend whom they dearly loved.&nbsp; It was the
picture of Mrs. Villars in a small bracelet.&nbsp; It wanted
neither gold, pearls nor precious stones to give it value.</p>
<p>The two foremost candidates for this prize were Cecilia and
Leonora.&nbsp; Cecilia was the most intimate friend of Leonora;
but Leonora was only the favourite companion of Cecilia.</p>
<p>Cecilia was of an active, ambitious, enterprising disposition,
more eager in the pursuit than happy in the enjoyment of her
wishes.&nbsp; Leonora was of a contented, unaspiring temperate
character; not easily roused to action, but indefatigable when
once excited.&nbsp; Leonora was proud; Cecilia was vain.&nbsp;
Her vanity made her more dependent upon the approbation of
others, and therefore more anxious to please than Leonora; but
that very vanity made her, at the same time, more apt to
offend.&nbsp; In short, Leonora was the most anxious to avoid
what was wrong; Cecilia, the most ambitious to do what was
right.&nbsp; Few of her companions loved, but many were led by
Cecilia, for she was often successful.&nbsp; Many loved Leonora,
but none were ever governed by her, for she was too indolent to
govern.</p>
<p>On the first day of May, about six o&rsquo;clock in the
evening, a great bell rang, to summon this little society into a
hall, where the prize was to be decided.&nbsp; A number of small
tables were placed in a circle in the middle of the hall.&nbsp;
Seats for the young competitors were raised one above another, in
a semicircle, some yards distant from the table, and the
judges&rsquo; chairs, under canopies of lilacs and laburnums,
forming another semicircle, closed the amphitheatre.</p>
<p>Everyone put their writings, their drawings, their works of
various kinds upon the tables appropriated for each.&nbsp; How
unsteady were the last steps to these tables!&nbsp; How each
little hand trembled as it laid down its claims!&nbsp; Till this
moment everyone thought herself secure of success; and the heart,
which exulted with hope, now palpitated with fear.</p>
<p>The works were examined, the preference adjudged, and the
prize was declared to be the happy Cecilia&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mrs.
Villars came forward, smiling, with the bracelet in her
hand.&nbsp; Cecilia was behind her companions, on the highest
row.&nbsp; All the others gave way, and she was on the floor in
an instant.&nbsp; Mrs. Villars clasped the bracelet on her arm;
the clasp was heard through the whole hall, and a universal smile
of congratulation followed.&nbsp; Mrs. Villars kissed
Cecilia&rsquo;s little hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;go and rejoice with your companions; the remainder of
the day is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! you whose hearts are elated with success, whose bosoms
beat high with joy in the moment of triumph, command
yourselves.&nbsp; Let that triumph be moderate, that it may be
lasting.&nbsp; Consider, that though you are good, you may be
better; and, though wise, you may be weak.</p>
<p>As soon as Mrs. Villars had given her the bracelet, all
Cecilia&rsquo;s little companions crowded round her, and they all
left the hall in an instant.&nbsp; She was full of spirits and
vanity.&nbsp; She ran on.&nbsp; Running down the flight of steps
which led to the garden, in her violent haste, Cecilia threw down
the little Louisa, who had a china mandarin in her hand, which
her mother had sent her that very morning, and which was all
broken to pieces by her fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my mandarin!&rdquo; cried Louisa, bursting into
tears.&nbsp; The crowd behind Cecilia suddenly stopped.&nbsp;
Louisa sat on the lowest step, fixing her eyes upon the broken
pieces.&nbsp; Then, turning round, she hid her face in her hands
upon the step above her.&nbsp; In turning, Louisa threw down the
remains of the mandarin.&nbsp; The head, which she placed in the
socket, fell from the shoulders, and rolled, bounding along the
gravel walk.&nbsp; Cecilia pointed to the head and to the socket,
and burst into laughter.&nbsp; The crowd behind laughed, too.</p>
<p>At any other time they would have been more inclined to cry
with Louisa; but Cecilia had just been successful, and sympathy
with the victorious often makes us forget justice.</p>
<p>Leonora, however, preserved her usual consistency.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Poor Louisa!&rdquo; said she, looking first at her, and
then reproachfully at Cecilia.&nbsp; Cecilia turned sharply
round, colouring, half with shame and half with vexation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could not help it, Leonora,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you could have helped laughing, Cecilia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t laugh at Louisa; and I surely may laugh,
for it does nobody any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure, however,&rdquo; replied Leonora, &ldquo;I
should not have laughed if I had&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to be sure, you wouldn&rsquo;t, because Louisa is
your favourite.&nbsp; I can buy her another mandarin when the old
peddler comes to the door, if that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I
<i>can</i> do no more, <i>can</i> I?&rdquo; said she, again
turning round to her companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, to be
sure,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecilia looked triumphantly at Leonora.&nbsp; Leonora let go
her hand; she ran on, and the crowd followed.&nbsp; When she got
to the end of the garden, she turned round to see if Leonora had
followed her, too; but was vexed to see her still sitting on the
steps with Louisa.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can do no more
than buy her another, <i>can</i> I!&rdquo; said she, again
appealing to her companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, to be sure,&rdquo;
said they, eager to begin their play.</p>
<p>How many games did these juvenile playmates begin and leave
off, before Cecilia could be satisfied with any!&nbsp; Her
thoughts were discomposed, and her mind was running upon
something else.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that she did not play with
her usual address.&nbsp; She grew still more impatient.&nbsp; She
threw down the ninepins.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, let us play at
something else&mdash;at threading the needle,&rdquo; said she,
holding out her hand.&nbsp; They all yielded to the hand which
wore the bracelet.&nbsp; But Cecilia, dissatisfied with herself,
was discontented with everybody else.&nbsp; Her tone grew more
and more peremptory.&nbsp; One was too rude, another too stiff;
one too slow, another too quick; in short everything went wrong,
and everybody was tired of her humours.</p>
<p>The triumph of <i>success</i> is absolute, but short.&nbsp;
Cecilia&rsquo;s companions at length recollected that though she
had embroidered a tulip, and painted a peach, better than they,
yet that they could play as well, and keep their tempers better;
for she was discomposed.</p>
<p>Walking towards the house in a peevish mood, Cecilia met
Leonora, but passed on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cecilia!&rdquo; cried
Leonora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know best,&rdquo; said Cecilia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are, if you will let me tell Louisa that you are
sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecilia, interrupting her, &ldquo;Oh, pray let me hear no more
about Louisa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! not confess that you were in the wrong?&nbsp; Oh,
Cecilia! I had a better opinion of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your opinion is of no consequence to me now, for you
don&rsquo;t love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; not when you are unjust, Cecilia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unjust! I am not unjust; and if I were, you are not my
governess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but am not I your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t desire to have such a friend, who would
quarrel with me for happening to throw down little Louisa.&nbsp;
How could I tell that she had a mandarin in her hand? and when it
was broken, could I do more than promise her another; was that
unjust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know, Cecilia&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>know</i>,&rdquo; ironically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know,
Leonora, that you love Louisa better than you love me;
that&rsquo;s the injustice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did,&rdquo; replied Leonora, gravely, &ldquo;it
would be no injustice, if she deserved it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you compare Louisa to me!&rdquo; exclaimed
Cecilia, indignantly.</p>
<p>Leonora made no answer; for she was really hurt at her
friend&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp; She walked on to join the rest of
her companions.&nbsp; They were dancing in a round upon the
grass.&nbsp; Leonora declined dancing; but they prevailed upon
her to sing for them.&nbsp; Her voice was not so sprightly, but
it was sweeter than usual.&nbsp; Who sang so sweetly as Leonora?
or who danced so nimbly as Louisa?&nbsp; Away she was flying, all
spirits and gaiety, when Leonora&rsquo;s eyes full of tears,
caught hers.&nbsp; Louisa silently let go her companion&rsquo;s
hand, and, quitting the dance, ran up to Leonora to inquire what
was the matter with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied
she, &ldquo;that need interrupt you.&nbsp; Go, my dear; go and
dance again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louisa immediately ran away to her garden, and pulling off her
little straw hat, she lined it with the freshest
strawberry-leaves, and was upon her knees before the
strawberry-bed when Cecilia came by.&nbsp; Cecilia was not
disposed to be pleased with Louisa at that instant, for two
reasons; because she was jealous of her, and because she had
injured her.&nbsp; The injury, however, Louisa had already
forgotten.&nbsp; Perhaps to tell things just as they were, she
was not quite so much inclined to kiss Cecilia as she would have
been before the fall of her mandarin; but this was the utmost
extent of her malice, if it can be called malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there, little one?&rdquo; said
Cecilia, in a sharp tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you eating your early
strawberries here all alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Louisa, mysteriously, &ldquo;I am not
eating them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with them? can&rsquo;t you answer,
then?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not playing with you, child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as to that, Cecilia, you know I need not answer you
unless I choose it; not but what I would if you would only ask me
civilly, and if you would not call me <i>child</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should not I call you child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know; but I
wish you would stand out of my light, Cecilia, for you are
trampling upon all my strawberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not touched one, you covetous little
creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed&mdash;indeed, Cecilia, I am not covetous.&nbsp;
I have not eaten one of them; they are all for your friend
Leonora.&nbsp; See how unjust you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unjust! that&rsquo;s a cant word which you learnt of my
friend Leonora, as you call her; but she is not my friend
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your friend now!&rdquo; exclaimed Louisa;
&ldquo;then I am sure you must have done something <i>very</i>
naughty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried Cecilia, catching hold of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go, let me go!&rdquo; cried Louisa,
struggling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t give you one of my
strawberries, for I don&rsquo;t like you at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried Cecilia,
provoked, and, catching the hat from Louisa, she flung the
strawberries over the hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will nobody help me?&rdquo; exclaimed Louisa, snatching
her hat again, and running away with all her force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; said Cecilia, recollecting
herself; &ldquo;Louisa! Louisa!&rdquo; she called very loud, but
Louisa would not turn back; she was running to her companions,
who were still dancing, hand in hand, upon the grass, whilst
Leonora, sitting in the middle, was singing to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop! and hear me!&rdquo; cried Louisa, breaking
through them; and, rushing up to Leonora, she threw her hat at
her feet, and panting for breath&mdash;&ldquo;It was
full&mdash;almost full of my own strawberries,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;the first I ever got out of my garden.&nbsp; They should
all have been for you, Leonora; but now I have not one
left.&nbsp; They are all gone!&rdquo; said she; and she hid her
face in Leonora&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone! gone where?&rdquo; said everyone, at once running
up to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cecilia! Cecilia!&rdquo; said she, sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cecilia,&rdquo; repeated Leonora, &ldquo;what of
Cecilia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was&mdash;it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Leonora, unwilling to have
her friend exposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, and I will get you some
more strawberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind the strawberries, indeed; but I
wanted to have had the pleasure of giving them to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonora took her up in her arms to carry her away, but it was
too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Cecilia! Cecilia, who won the prize!&nbsp; It
could not surely be Cecilia,&rdquo; whispered every busy
tongue.</p>
<p>At this instant the bell summoned them in.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
she is!&nbsp; There she is!&rdquo; cried they, pointing to an
arbour, where Cecilia was standing ashamed and alone; and, as
they passed her, some lifted up their hands and eyes with
astonishment, others whispered and huddled mysteriously together,
as if to avoid her.&nbsp; Leonora walked on, her head a little
higher than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leonora!&rdquo; said Cecilia, timorously, as she
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cecilia! who would have thought that you had a bad
heart?&rdquo;&nbsp; Cecilia turned her head aside and burst into
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed, she has not a bad heart!&rdquo; cried
Louisa, running up to her and throwing her arms around her
neck.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very sorry; are not you,
Cecilia?&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t cry any more, for I forgive you,
with all my heart&mdash;and I love you now, though I said I did
not when I was in a passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you sweet-tempered girl! how I love you!&rdquo;
said Cecilia, kissing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, if you do, come along with me, and dry your
eyes, for they are so red!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, my dear, and I&rsquo;ll come presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will keep a place for you, next to me; but you
must make haste, or you will have to come in when we have all sat
down to supper, and then you will be so stared at!&nbsp; So
don&rsquo;t stay, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecilia followed Louisa with her eyes till she was out of
sight.&nbsp; &ldquo;And is Louisa,&rdquo; said she, to herself,
&ldquo;the only one who would stop to pity me?&nbsp; Mrs. Villars
told me that this day should be mine.&nbsp; She little thought
how it would end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying these words, Cecilia threw herself down upon the
ground; her arm leaned upon a heap of turf which she had raised
in the morning, and which, in the pride and gaiety of her heart,
she had called her throne.</p>
<p>At this instant, Mrs. Villars came out to enjoy the serenity
of the evening, and, passing by the arbour where Cecilia lay, she
started.&nbsp; Cecilia rose hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said Mrs. Villars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is <i>I</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cecilia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what keeps you here, my dear?&nbsp; Where are your
companions?&nbsp; This is, perhaps, one of the happiest days of
your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, madam,&rdquo; said Cecilia, hardly able to
repress her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, what is the matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; Cecilia
hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak, my dear.&nbsp; You know that when
I ask you to tell me anything as your friend, I never punish you
as your governess; therefore you need not be afraid to tell me
what is the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam, I am not afraid, but ashamed.&nbsp; You
asked me why I was not with my companions.&nbsp; Why, madam,
because they have all left me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I see that they all dislike me; and yet I
don&rsquo;t know why they should, for I take as much pains to
please as any of them.&nbsp; All my masters seem satisfied with
me; and you yourself, madam, were pleased this very morning to
give me this bracelet; and I am sure you would not have given it
to anyone who did not deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Villars.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You well deserve it for your application&mdash;for your
successful application.&nbsp; The prize was for the most
assiduous, not for the most amiable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if it had been for the most amiable, it would not
have been for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Villars, smiling,&mdash;&ldquo;Why, what do you think
yourself, Cecilia?&nbsp; You are better able to judge than I
am.&nbsp; I can determine whether or no you apply to what I give
you to learn; whether you attend to what I desire you to do, and
avoid what I desire you not to do.&nbsp; I know that I like you
as a pupil, but I cannot know that I should like you as a
companion, unless I were your companion.&nbsp; Therefore I must
judge of what I should do, by seeing what others do in the same
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t, madam! for then you would not
love me either.&nbsp; And yet I think you would love me; for I
hope that I am as ready to oblige, and as good-natured
as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Cecilia, I don&rsquo;t doubt but that you would be
very good natured to me; but I&rsquo;m afraid that I should not
like you unless you were good-tempered, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, madam, by good-natured I mean
good-tempered&mdash;it&rsquo;s all the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I understand by them two very different
things.&nbsp; You are good-natured, Cecilia; for you are desirous
to oblige and serve your companions&mdash;to gain them praise,
and save them from blame&mdash;to give them pleasure, and relieve
them from pain; but Leonora is good-tempered, for she can bear
with their foibles, and acknowledge her own.&nbsp; Without
disputing about the right, she sometimes yields to those who are
in the wrong.&nbsp; In short, her temper is perfectly good; for
it can bear and forbear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that mine could!&rdquo; said Cecilia,
sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Villars; &ldquo;but it is
not wishes alone which can improve us in anything.&nbsp; Turn the
same exertion and perseverance which have won you the prize
to-day to this object, and you will meet with the same success;
perhaps not on the first, the second, or the third attempt; but
depend upon it that you will at last.&nbsp; Every new effort will
weaken your bad habits, and strengthen your good ones.&nbsp; But
you must not expect to succeed all at once.&nbsp; I repeat it to
you, for habit must be counteracted by habit.&nbsp; It would be
as extravagant in us to expect that all our faults could be
destroyed by one punishment, were it ever so severe, as it was in
the Roman emperor we were reading of a few days ago, to wish that
all the heads of his enemies were upon one neck, that he might
cut them off at one blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Villars took Cecilia by the hand, and they began to
walk home.&nbsp; Such was the nature of Cecilia&rsquo;s mind,
that when any object was forcibly impressed on her imagination,
it caused a temporary suspension of her reasoning
faculties.&nbsp; Hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits;
and when fear did take possession of her mind, it was attended
with total debility.&nbsp; Her vanity was now as much mortified
as in the morning it had been elated.&nbsp; She walked on with
Mrs. Villars in silence, until they came under the shade of the
elm-tree walk, and there, fixing her eyes upon Mrs. Villars, she
stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, madam,&rdquo; said she, with
hesitation&mdash;&ldquo;do you think, madam, that I have a bad
heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad heart,&mdash;my dear! why, what put that into
your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leonora said that I had, madam, and I felt ashamed when
she said so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, how can Leonora tell whether your heart
be good or bad?&nbsp; However, in the first place, tell me what
you mean by a bad heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do not know what is meant by it, madam; but it
is something which everybody hates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why do they hate it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they think that it will hurt them, ma&rsquo;am,
I believe: and that those who have bad hearts take delight in
doing mischief; and that they never do anybody any good but for
their own ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the best definition,&rdquo; said Mrs. Villars,
&ldquo;which you can give me of a bad heart is, that it is some
constant propensity to hurt others, and to do wrong for the sake
of doing wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam; but that is not all either.&nbsp; There is
still something else meant; something which I cannot
express&mdash;which, indeed, I never distinctly understood; but
of which, therefore, I was the more afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, to begin with what you do understand, tell
me, Cecilia, do you really think it possible to be wicked merely
for the love of wickedness?&nbsp; No human being becomes wicked
all at once.&nbsp; A man begins by doing wrong because it is, or
because he thinks it, for his interest.&nbsp; If he continue to
do so, he must conquer his sense of shame and lose his love of
virtue.&nbsp; But how can you, Cecilia, who feel such a strong
sense of shame, and such an eager desire to improve, imagine that
you have a bad heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, madam, I never did, until everybody told me so,
and then I began to be frightened about it.&nbsp; This very
evening, madam, when I was in a passion, I threw little
Louisa&rsquo;s strawberries away, which, I am sure, I was very
sorry for afterwards; and Leonora and everybody cried out that I
had a bad heart&mdash;but I am sure I was only in a
passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely.&nbsp; And when you are in a passion, as
you call it, Cecilia, you see that you are tempted to do harm to
others.&nbsp; If they do not feel angry themselves, they do not
sympathize with you.&nbsp; They do not perceive the motive which
actuates you; and then they say that you have a bad heart.&nbsp;
I daresay, however, when your passion is over, and when you
recollect yourself, you are very sorry for what you have done and
said; are not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, madam&mdash;very sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make that sorry of use to you, Cecilia, and fix it
steadily in your thoughts, as you hope to be good and happy, that
if you suffer yourself to yield to your passion upon every
occasion, anger and its consequences will become familiar to your
mind; and, in the same proportion, your sense of shame will be
weakened, till what you began with doing from sudden impulse you
will end with doing from habit and choice: then you would,
indeed, according to our definition, have a bad heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, madam! I hope&mdash;I am sure I never
shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, Cecilia; I do, indeed, believe that you
never will; on the contrary, I think that you have a very good
disposition, and what is of infinitely more consequence to you,
an active desire of improvement.&nbsp; Show me that you have as
much perseverance as you have candour, and I shall not despair of
your becoming everything that I could wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Cecilia&rsquo;s countenance brightened, and she ran up
the steps in almost as high spirits as she ran down them in the
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night to you, Cecilia,&rdquo; said Mrs. Villars,
as she was crossing the hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-night to you,
madam,&rdquo; said Cecilia; and she ran upstairs to bed.&nbsp;
She could not go to sleep; but she lay awake, reflecting upon the
events of the preceding day, and forming resolutions for the
future, at the same time that she had resolved, and resolved
without effect, she wished to give her mind some more powerful
motive.&nbsp; Ambition she knew to be its most powerful
incentive.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I not,&rdquo; said she to herself,
&ldquo;already won the prize of application, and cannot the same
application procure me a much higher prize?&nbsp; Mrs. Villars
said that if the prize had been promised to the most amiable, it
would not have been given to me.&nbsp; Perhaps it would not
yesterday, perhaps it might not to-morrow; but that is no reason
that I should despair of ever deserving it.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In consequence of this reasoning, Cecilia formed a design of
proposing to her companions that they should give a prize, the
first of the ensuing month (the 1st of June), to the most
amiable.&nbsp; Mrs. Villars applauded the scheme, and her
companions adopted it with the greatest alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the prize,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;be a bracelet
of our own hair;&rdquo; and instantly their shining scissors were
produced, and each contributed a lock of their hair.&nbsp; They
formed the most beautiful gradation of colours, from the palest
auburn to the brightest black.&nbsp; Who was to have the honour
of plaiting them? was now the question.&nbsp; Caroline begged
that she might, as she could plait very neatly, she said.&nbsp;
Cecilia, however, was equally sure that she could do it much
better; and a dispute would have inevitably ensued, if Cecilia,
recollecting herself just as her colour rose to scarlet, had not
yielded&mdash;yielded, with no very good grace indeed, but as
well as could be expected for the first time.&nbsp; For it is
habit which confers ease; and without ease, even in moral
actions, there can be no grace.</p>
<p>The bracelet was plaited in the neatest manner by Caroline,
finished round the edge with silver twist, and on it was worked,
in the smallest silver letters, this motto, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">To the Most Amiable</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The moment
it was completed, everybody begged to try it on.&nbsp; It
fastened with little silver clasps, and as it was made large
enough for the eldest girls, it was too large for the
youngest.&nbsp; Of this they bitterly complained, and unanimously
entreated that it might be cut to fit them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How foolish!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you perceive that if any of you win it, you
have nothing to do but to put the clips a little further from the
edge, but if we get it, we can&rsquo;t make it larger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;but you need not to
have called us foolish, Cecilia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was by such hasty and unguarded expressions as these that
Cecilia offended.&nbsp; A slight difference in the manner makes a
very material one in the effect.&nbsp; Cecilia lost more love by
general petulance than she could gain by the greatest particular
exertions.</p>
<p>How far she succeeded in curing herself of this
defect&mdash;how far she became deserving of the bracelet, and to
whom the bracelet was given&mdash;shall be told in the History of
the First of June.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The First of June was now arrived, and all the young
competitors were in a state of the most anxious suspense.&nbsp;
Leonora and Cecilia continued to be the foremost
candidates.&nbsp; Their quarrel had never been finally adjusted,
and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a
reconciliation.&nbsp; Cecilia, though she was capable of
acknowledging any of her faults in public before all her
companions, could not humble herself in private to Leonora.&nbsp;
Leonora was her equal; they were her inferiors, and submission is
much easier to a vain mind, where it appears to be voluntary,
than when it is the necessary tribute to justice or
candour.&nbsp; So strongly did Cecilia feel this truth, that she
even delayed making any apology, or coming to any explanation
with Leonora, until success should once more give her the
palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I win the bracelet, to-day,&rdquo; said she to
herself, &ldquo;I will solicit the return of Leonora&rsquo;s
friendship; it will be more valuable to me than even the
bracelet, and at such a time, and asked in such a manner, she
surely cannot refuse it to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Animated with this
hope of a double triumph, Cecilia canvassed with the most zealous
activity.&nbsp; By constant attention and exertion she had
considerably abated the violence of her temper, and changed the
course of her habits.&nbsp; Her powers of pleasing were now
excited, instead of her abilities to excel; and, if her talents
appeared less brilliant, her character was acknowledged to be
more amiable.&nbsp; So great an influence upon our manners and
conduct have the objects of our ambition.</p>
<p>Cecilia was now, if possible, more than ever desirous of doing
what was right, but she had not yet acquired sufficient fear of
doing wrong.&nbsp; This was the fundamental error of her mind; it
arose in a great measure from her early education.&nbsp; Her
mother died when she was very young; and though her father had
supplied her place in the best and kindest manner, he had
insensibly infused into his daughter&rsquo;s mind a portion of
that enterprising, independent spirit which he justly deemed
essential to the character of her brother.&nbsp; This brother was
some years older than Cecilia, but he had always been the
favourite companion of her youth.&nbsp; What her father&rsquo;s
precepts inculcated, his example enforced; and even
Cecilia&rsquo;s virtues consequently became such as were more
estimable in a man than desirable in a female. All small objects
and small errors she had been taught to disregard as trifles; and
her impatient disposition was perpetually leading her into more
material faults; yet her candour in confessing these, she had
been suffered to believe, was sufficient reparation and
atonement.</p>
<p>Leonora, on the contrary, who had been educated by her mother
in a manner more suited to her sex, had a character and virtues
more peculiar to a female.&nbsp; Her judgment had been early
cultivated, and her good sense employed in the regulation of her
conduct.&nbsp; She had been habituated to that restraint, which,
as a woman, she was to expect in life, and early accustomed to
yield.&nbsp; Compliance in her seemed natural and graceful; yet
notwithstanding the gentleness of her temper, she was in reality
more independent than Cecilia.&nbsp; She had more reliance upon
her own judgment, and more satisfaction in her own
approbation.&nbsp; The uniform kindness of her manner, the
consistency and equality of her character, had fixed the esteem
and passive love of her companions.</p>
<p>By passive love we mean that species of affection which makes
us unwilling to offend rather than anxious to oblige, which is
more a habit than an emotion of the mind.&nbsp; For Cecilia her
companions felt active love, for she was active in showing her
love to them.</p>
<p>Active love arises spontaneously in the mind, after feeling
particular instances of kindness, without reflection on the past
conduct or general character.&nbsp; It exceeds the merits of its
object, and is connected with a feeling of generosity, rather
than with a sense of justice.</p>
<p>Without determining which species of love is the most
flattering to others, we can easily decide which is the most
agreeable feeling to our minds.&nbsp; We give our hearts more
credit for being generous than for being just; and we feel more
self-complacency when we give our love voluntarily, than when we
yield it as a tribute which we cannot withhold.&nbsp; Though
Cecilia&rsquo;s companions might not know all this in theory,
they proved it in practice; for they loved her in a much higher
proportion to her merits than they loved Leonora.</p>
<p>Each of the young judges were to signify their choice by
putting a red or a white shell into a vase prepared for the
purpose.&nbsp; Cecilia&rsquo;s colour was red, Leonora&rsquo;s
white.</p>
<p>In the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells;
nothing talked of but the long expected event of the
evening.&nbsp; Cecilia, following Leonora&rsquo;s example, had
made it a point of honour not to inquire of any individual her
vote, previously to their final determination.</p>
<p>They were both sitting together in Louisa&rsquo;s room.&nbsp;
Louisa was recovering from the measles.&nbsp; Everyone during her
illness had been desirous of attending her; but Leonora and
Cecilia were the only two that were permitted to see her, as they
alone had had the distemper.&nbsp; They were both assiduous in
their care of Louisa, but Leonora&rsquo;s want of exertion to
overcome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived
her of presence of mind, and prevented her from being so
constantly useful as Cecilia.&nbsp; Cecilia, on the contrary,
often made too much noise and bustle with her officious
assistance, and was too anxious to invent amusements and procure
comforts for Louisa, without perceiving that illness takes away
the power of enjoying them.</p>
<p>As she was sitting at the window in the morning, exerting
herself to entertain Louisa, she heard the voice of an old
peddler who often used to come to the house.&nbsp; Downstairs
they ran immediately, to ask Mrs. Villars&rsquo; permission to
bring him into the hall.&nbsp; Mrs. Villars consented, and away
Cecilia ran to proclaim the news to her companions.&nbsp; Then,
first returning into the hall, she found the peddler just
unbuckling his box, and taking it off his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you be pleased to want, miss?&rdquo; said
the peddler; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve all kinds of tweezer-cases, rings,
and lockets of all sorts,&rdquo; continued he, opening all the
glittering drawers successively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Cecilia, shutting the drawer of lockets
which tempted her most, &ldquo;these are not the things which I
want.&nbsp; Have you any china figures? any mandarins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alack-a-day, miss, I had a great stock of that same
chinaware; but now I&rsquo;m quite out of them kind of things;
but I believe,&rdquo; said he, rummaging one of the deepest
drawers, &ldquo;I believe I have one left, and here it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is the very thing! what&rsquo;s its
price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only three shillings, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cecilia
paid the money, and was just going to carry off the mandarin,
when the peddler took out of his great-coat pocket a neat
mahogany case.&nbsp; It was about a foot long, and fastened at
each end by two little clasps.&nbsp; It had besides, a small lock
in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Cecilia, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a china figure, miss, which I am going
to carry to an elderly lady, who lives nigh hand, and who is
mighty fond of such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you let me look at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And welcome, miss,&rdquo; said he, and opened the
case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness! how beautiful!&rdquo; exclaimed
Cecilia.</p>
<p>It was a figure of Flora, crowned with roses, and carrying a
basket of flowers in her hand.&nbsp; Cecilia contemplated it with
delight.&nbsp; &ldquo;How I should like to give this to
Louisa!&rdquo; said she to herself; and, at last, breaking
silence, &ldquo;Did you promise it to the old lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, miss, I didn&rsquo;t promise it&mdash;she never
saw it; and if so be that you&rsquo;d like to take it, I&rsquo;d
make no more words about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much does it cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, miss, as to that, I&rsquo;ll let you have it for
half-a-guinea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecilia immediately produced the box in which she kept her
treasure, and, emptying it upon the table, she began to count the
shillings.&nbsp; Alas! there were but six shillings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How provoking!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;then I can&rsquo;t
have it.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the mandarin?&nbsp; Oh, I have
it,&rdquo; said she, taking it up, and looking at it with the
utmost disgust.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this the same that I had
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, miss, the very same,&rdquo; replied the peddler,
who, during this time, had been examining the little box out of
which Cecilia had taken her money&mdash;it was of silver.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since
you&rsquo;ve taken such a fancy to the piece, if you&rsquo;ve a
mind to make up the remainder of the money, I will take this here
little box, if you care to part with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this box was a keepsake from Leonora to Cecilia.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cecilia hastily, blushing a little, and
stretching out her hand to receive it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, miss!&rdquo; said he, returning it carelessly,
&ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;s no offence.&nbsp; I meant but to
serve you, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Such a rare piece of
china-work has no cause to go a-begging,&rdquo; added he.&nbsp;
Then, putting the Flora deliberately into the case, and turning
the key with a jerk, he let it drop into his pocket; when,
lifting up his box by the leather straps, he was preparing to
depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stay one minute!&rdquo; said Cecilia, in whose mind
there had passed a very warm conflict during the peddler&rsquo;s
harangue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Louisa would so like this Flora,&rdquo;
said she, arguing with herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, it would be
so generous in me to give it to her instead of that ugly
mandarin; that would be doing only common justice, for I promised
it to her, and she expects it.&nbsp; Though, when I come to look
at this mandarin, it is not even so good as hers was.&nbsp; The
gilding is all rubbed off, so that I absolutely must buy this for
her.&nbsp; Oh, yes! I will, and she will be so delighted! and
then everybody will say it is the prettiest thing they ever saw,
and the broken mandarin will be forgotten for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Cecilia&rsquo;s hand moved, and she was just going to
decide: &ldquo;Oh, but stop,&rdquo; said she to herself,
&ldquo;consider&mdash;Leonora gave me this box, and it is a
keepsake.&nbsp; However, we have now quarrelled, and I dare say
that she would not mind my parting with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
that I should not care if she was to give away my keepsake, the
smelling-bottle, or the ring which I gave her.&nbsp; Then what
does it signify?&nbsp; Besides, is it not my own? and have I not
a right to do what I please with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, so critical for Cecilia, a party of her
companions opened the door.&nbsp; She knew that they came as
purchasers, and she dreaded her Flora&rsquo;s becoming the prize
of some higher bidder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said she,
hastily putting the box into the peddler&rsquo;s hand, without
looking at it; &ldquo;take it, and give me the
Flora.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her hand trembled, though she snatched it
impatiently.&nbsp; She ran by, without seeming to mind any of her
companions.</p>
<p>Let those who are tempted to do wrong by the hopes of future
gratification, or the prospect of certain concealment and
impunity, remember that, unless they are totally depraved, they
bear in their own hearts a monitor, who will prevent their
enjoying what they ill obtained.</p>
<p>In vain Cecilia ran to the rest of her companions, to display
her present, in hopes that the applause of others would restore
her own self-complacency; in vain she saw the Flora pass in due
pomp from hand to hand, each vying with the other in extolling
the beauty of the gift and the generosity of the giver.&nbsp;
Cecilia was still displeased with herself, with them, and even
with their praise.&nbsp; From Louisa&rsquo;s gratitude, however,
she yet expected much pleasure, and immediately she ran upstairs
to her room.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Leonora had gone into the hall to buy a
bodkin; she had just broken hers.&nbsp; In giving her change, the
peddler took out of his pocket, with some halfpence, the very box
which Cecilia had sold to him.&nbsp; Leonora did not in the least
suspect the truth, for her mind was above suspicion; and besides,
she had the utmost confidence in Cecilia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to have that box,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;for it is like one of which I was very fond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peddler named the price, and Leonora took the box.&nbsp;
She intended to give it to little Louisa.&nbsp; On going to her
room she found her asleep, and she sat softly down by her
bedside.&nbsp; Louisa opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t disturb you,&rdquo; said
Leonora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t hear you come in; but what
have you got there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little box; would you like to have it?&nbsp; I
bought on purpose for you, as I thought perhaps it would please
you, because it&rsquo;s like that which I gave
Cecilia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! that out of which she used to give me Barbary
drops.&nbsp; I am very much obliged to you; I always thought that
exceedingly pretty, and this, indeed, is as like it as
possible.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t unscrew it; will you
try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonora unscrewed it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed
Louisa, &ldquo;this must be Cecilia&rsquo;s box.&nbsp; Look,
don&rsquo;t you see a great L at the bottom of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonora&rsquo;s colour changed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
replied calmly, &ldquo;I see that; but it is no proof that it is
Cecilia&rsquo;s.&nbsp; You know that I bought this box just now
of the peddler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Louisa; &ldquo;but I remember
scratching that L with my own needle, and Cecilia scolded me for
it, too.&nbsp; Do go and ask her if she has lost her
box&mdash;do,&rdquo; repeated Louisa, pulling her by the ruffle,
as she did not seem to listen.</p>
<p>Leonora, indeed, did not hear, for she was lost in
thought.&nbsp; She was comparing circumstances, which had before
escaped her attention.&nbsp; She recollected that Cecilia had
passed her as she came into the hall, without seeming to see her,
but had blushed as she passed.&nbsp; She remembered that the
peddler appeared unwilling to part with the box, and was going to
put it again in his pocket with the halfpence.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
why should he keep it in his pocket, and not show it with his
other things?&rdquo;&nbsp; Combining all these circumstances,
Leonora had no longer any doubt of the truth, for though she had
honourable confidence in her friends, she had too much
penetration to be implicitly credulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louisa,&rdquo; she began, but at this instant she heard
a step, which, by its quickness, she knew to be Cecilia&rsquo;s,
coming along the passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you love me,
Louisa,&rdquo; said Leonora, &ldquo;say nothing about the
box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but why not?&nbsp; I daresay she had lost
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, I&rsquo;m afraid she has not.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Louisa looked surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I have reasons for
desiring you not to say anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I won&rsquo;t, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecilia opened the door, came forward smiling, as if secure of
a good reception, and taking the Flora out of the case, she
placed it on the mantlepiece, opposite to Louisa&rsquo;s
bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear, how beautiful!&rdquo; cried Louisa,
starting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;and guess who
it&rsquo;s for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, perhaps!&rdquo; said the ingenuous Louisa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, take it, and keep it, for my sake.&nbsp; You know
that I broke your mandarin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this is a great deal prettier and larger than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it is; and I meant that it should be
so.&nbsp; I should only have done what I was bound to do if I had
only given you a mandarin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Louisa, &ldquo;and that would have
been enough, surely; but what a beautiful crown of roses! and
then that basket of flowers! they almost look as if I could smell
them.&nbsp; Dear Cecilia, I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you; but
I won&rsquo;t take it by way of payment for the mandarin you
broke; for I&rsquo;m sure you could not help that, and, besides,
I should have broken it myself by this time.&nbsp; You shall give
it to me entirely; and as your keepsake, I&rsquo;ll keep it as
long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louisa stopped short and coloured; the word keepsake recalled
the box to her mind, and all the train of ideas which the Flora
had banished.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said she, looking up
wistfully in Cecilia&rsquo;s face, and holding the Flora
doubtfully, &ldquo;did you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonora, who was just quitting the room, turned her head back,
and gave Louisa a look, which silenced her.</p>
<p>Cecilia was so infatuated with her vanity, that she neither
perceived Leonora&rsquo;s sign nor Louisa&rsquo;s confusion, but
continued showing off her present, by placing it in various
situations, till at length she put it into the case, and laying
it down with an affected carelessness upon the bed, &ldquo;I must
go now, Louisa.&nbsp; Good-bye,&rdquo; said she, running up and
kissing her; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll come again presently,&rdquo;
then, clapping the door after her she went.&nbsp; But as soon as
the formentation of her spirits subsided, the sense of shame,
which had been scarcely felt when mixed with so many other
sensations, rose uppermost in her mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
said she to herself, &ldquo;is it possible that I have sold what
I promised to keep for ever? and what Leonora gave me? and I have
concealed it too, and have been making a parade of my
generosity.&nbsp; Oh! what would Leonora, what would
Louisa&mdash;what would everybody think of me, if the truth were
known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humiliated and grieved by these reflections, Cecilia began to
search in her own mind for some consoling idea.&nbsp; She began
to compare her conduct with that of others of her own age; and at
length, fixing her comparison upon her brother George, as the
companion of whom, from her infancy, she had been habitually the
most emulous, she recollected that an almost similar circumstance
had once happened to him, and that he had not only escaped
disgrace, but had acquired glory, by an intrepid confession of
his fault.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s word to her brother, on the
occasion, she also perfectly recollected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to me, George,&rdquo; he said holding out his
hand, &ldquo;you are a generous, brave boy: they who dare to
confess their faults will make great and good men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were his words; but Cecilia, in repeating them to
herself, forgot to lay that emphasis on the word <i>men</i>,
which would have placed it in contradistinction to the word
women.&nbsp; She willingly believed that the observation extended
equally to both sexes, and flattered herself that she should
exceed her brother in merit if she owned a fault, which she
thought that it would be so much more difficult to confess.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, but,&rdquo; said she, stopping herself, &ldquo;how
can I confess it?&nbsp; This very evening, in a few hours, the
prize will be decided.&nbsp; Leonora or I shall win it.&nbsp; I
have now as good a chance as Leonora, perhaps a better; and must
I give up all my hopes&mdash;all that I have been labouring for
this month past?&nbsp; Oh, I never can!&nbsp; If it were but
to-morrow, or yesterday, or any day but this, I would not
hesitate; but now I am almost certain of the prize, and if I win
it&mdash;well, why then I will&mdash;I think I will tell
all&mdash;yes I will; I am determined,&rdquo; said Cecilia.</p>
<p>Here a bell summoned them to dinner.&nbsp; Leonora sat
opposite to her, and she was not a little surprised to see
Cecilia look so gay and unconstrained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said she to herself, &ldquo;if Cecilia had
done that which I suspect, she would not, she could not, look as
she does.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Leonora little knew the cause of her
gaiety.&nbsp; Cecilia was never in higher spirits, or better
pleased with herself, than when she had resolved upon a sacrifice
or a confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must not this evening be given to the most
amiable?&nbsp; Whose, then, will it be?&rdquo;&nbsp; All eyes
glanced first at Cecilia, and then at Leonora.&nbsp; Cecilia
smiled; Leonora blushed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see that it is not yet
decided,&rdquo; said Mrs. Villars; and immediately they ran
upstairs, amidst confused whisperings.</p>
<p>Cecilia&rsquo;s voice could be distinguished far above the
rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can she be so happy!&rdquo; said Leonora
to herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh Cecilia, there was a time when you
could not have neglected me so! when we were always together the
best of friends and companions; our wishes, tastes, and pleasures
the same!&nbsp; Surely she did once love me,&rdquo; said Leonora;
&ldquo;but now she is quite changed.&nbsp; She has even sold my
keepsake; and she would rather win a bracelet of hair from girls
whom she did not always think so much superior to Leonora, than
have my esteem, my confidence, and my friendship for her whole
life&mdash;yes, for her whole life, for I am sure she will be an
amiable woman.&nbsp; Oh, that this bracelet had never been
thought of, or that I were certain of her winning it; for I am
sure that I do not wish to win it from her.&nbsp; I would
rather&mdash;a thousand times rather&mdash;that we were as we
used to be than have all the glory in the world.&nbsp; And how
pleasing Cecilia can be when she wishes to please!&mdash;how
candid she is!&mdash;how much she can improve herself!&nbsp; Let
me be just, though she has offended me; she is wonderfully
improved within this last month.&nbsp; For one fault, and
<i>that</i> against myself, shall I forget all her
merits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Leonora said these last words, she could but just hear the
voices of her companions.&nbsp; They had left her alone in the
gallery.&nbsp; She knocked softly at Louisa&rsquo;s door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Louisa; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
asleep.&nbsp; Oh,&rdquo; said she, starting up with the Flora in
her hand, the instant that the door was opened; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so glad you are come, Leonora, for I did so long to hear what you
all were making such a noise about.&nbsp; Have you forgot that
the bracelet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! is this the evening?&rdquo; inquired
Leonora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s my white shell for you,&rdquo; said
Louisa.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept it in my pocket this
fortnight; and though Cecilia did give me this Flora, I still
love you a great deal better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Louisa,&rdquo; said Leonora,
gratefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will take your shell, and I shall
value it as long as I live; but here is a red one, and if you
wish to show me that you love me, you will give this to
Cecilia.&nbsp; I know that she is particularly anxious for your
preference, and I am sure that she deserves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I could I would choose both of you,&rdquo; said
Louisa, &ldquo;but you know I can only choose which I like the
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean, my dear Louisa,&rdquo; said Leonora,
&ldquo;that you like me the best, I am very much obliged to you,
for, indeed, I wish you to love me; but it is enough for me to
know it in private.&nbsp; I should not feel the least more
pleasure at hearing it in public, or in having it made known to
all my companions, especially at a time when it would give poor
Cecilia a great deal of pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should it give her pain?&rdquo; asked Louisa;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her for being jealous of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Louisa, surely you don&rsquo;t think Cecilia
jealous?&nbsp; She only tries to excel, and to please; she is
more anxious to succeed than I am, it is true, because she has a
great deal more activity, and perhaps more ambition.&nbsp; And it
would really mortify her to lose this prize&mdash;you know that
she proposed it herself.&nbsp; It has been her object for this
month past, and I am sure she has taken great pains to obtain
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear Leonora, why should you lose it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my dear, it would be no loss to me; and, if it
were, I would willingly suffer it for Cecilia; for, though we
seem not to be such good friends as we used to be, I love her
very much, and she will love me again&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure she
will; when she no longer fears me as a rival, she will again love
me as a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Leonora heard a number of her companions running along
the gallery.&nbsp; They all knocked hastily at the door, calling
&ldquo;Leonora! Leonora! will you never come?&nbsp; Cecilia has
been with us this half-hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonora smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Louisa,&rdquo; said she,
smiling, &ldquo;will you promise me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am sure, by the way they speak to you, that they
won&rsquo;t give you the prize!&rdquo; said the little Louisa,
and the tears started into her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;They love me,
though, for all that,&rdquo; said Leonora; &ldquo;and as for the
prize, you know whom I wish to have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leonora! Leonora!&rdquo; called her impatient
companions; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you hear us?&nbsp; What are you
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she never will take any trouble about
anything,&rdquo; said one of the party; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go, go! make haste!&rdquo; cried Louisa;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t stay; they are so angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, then, that you have promised me,&rdquo; said
Leonora, and she left the room.</p>
<p>During all this time, Cecilia had been in the garden with her
companions.&nbsp; The ambition which she had felt to win the
first prize&mdash;the prize of superior talents and superior
application&mdash;was not to be compared to the absolute anxiety
which she now expressed to win this simple testimony of the love
and approbation of her equals and rivals.</p>
<p>To employ her exuberant activity, Cecilia had been dragging
branches of lilacs and laburnums, roses and sweet briar, to
ornament the bower in which her fate was to be decided.&nbsp; It
was excessively hot, but her mind was engaged, and she was
indefatigable.&nbsp; She stood still at last to admire her
works.&nbsp; Her companions all joined in loud applause.&nbsp;
They were not a little prejudiced in her favour by the great
eagerness which she expressed to win their prize, and by the
great importance which she seemed to affix to the preference of
each individual.&nbsp; At last, &ldquo;Where is Leonora?&rdquo;
cried one of them; and immediately, as we have seen, they ran to
call her.</p>
<p>Cecilia was left alone.&nbsp; Overcome with heat and too
violent exertion, she had hardly strength to support herself;
each moment appeared to her intolerably long.&nbsp; She was in a
state of the utmost suspense, and all her courage failed
her.&nbsp; Even hope forsook her; and hope is a cordial which
leaves the mind depressed and enfeebled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time is now come,&rdquo; said Cecilia; &ldquo;in a
few moments all will be decided.&nbsp; In a few
moments&mdash;goodness!&nbsp; How much do I hazard?&nbsp; If I
should not win the prize, how shall I confess what I have
done?&nbsp; How shall I beg Leonora to forgive me?&nbsp; I, who
hoped to restore my friendship to her as an honour!&nbsp; They
are gone to seek for her.&nbsp; The moment she appears I shall be
forgotten.&nbsp; What&mdash;what shall I do?&rdquo; said Cecilia,
covering her face with her hands.</p>
<p>Such was Cecilia&rsquo;s situation when Leonora, accompanied
by her companions, opened the hall door.&nbsp; They most of them
ran forwards to Cecilia.&nbsp; As Leonora came into the bower,
she held out her hand to Cecilia.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not rivals,
but friends, I hope,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; Cecilia clasped her
hand; but she was in too great agitation to speak.</p>
<p>The table was now set in the arbour&mdash;the vase was now
placed in the middle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Cecilia,
eagerly, &ldquo;who begins?&rdquo;&nbsp; Caroline, one of her
friends, came forward first, and then all the others
successively.&nbsp; Cecilia&rsquo;s emotion was hardly
conceivable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now they are all in!&nbsp; Count them,
Caroline!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three, four; the numbers are both
equal.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a dead silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
they are not,&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia, pressing forward, and
putting a shell into a vase.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not given mine,
and I give it to Leonora.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, snatching the
bracelet, &ldquo;It is yours, Leonora,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;take it, and give me back your friendship.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The whole assembly gave one universal clap and a general shout of
applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot be surprised at this from you, Cecilia,&rdquo;
said Leonora; &ldquo;and do you then still love me as you used to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Leonora, stop! don&rsquo;t praise me; I don&rsquo;t
deserve this,&rdquo; said she, turning to her loudly applauding
companions.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will soon despise me.&nbsp; Oh,
Leonora, you will never forgive me!&nbsp; I have deceived you; I
have sold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant, Mrs. Villars appeared.&nbsp; The crowd
divided.&nbsp; She had heard all that passed, from her
window.&nbsp; &ldquo;I applaud your generosity, Cecilia,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;but I am to tell you that, in this instance it
is unsuccessful.&nbsp; You have not it in your power to give the
prize to Leonora.&nbsp; It is yours.&nbsp; I have another vote to
give to you.&nbsp; You have forgotten Louisa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louisa!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia; &ldquo;but surely,
ma&rsquo;am, Louisa loves Leonora better than she does
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She commissioned me, however,&rdquo; said Mrs. Villars,
&ldquo;to give you a red shell; and you will find it in this
box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cecilia started, and turned as pale as death; it was the fatal
box!</p>
<p>Mrs. Villars produced another box.&nbsp; She opened it; it
contained the Flora.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Louisa also desired
me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to return to you this
Flora.&rdquo;&nbsp; She put it into Cecilia&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
Cecilia trembled so that she could not hold it.&nbsp; Leonora
caught it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, madam!&nbsp; Oh, Leonora!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia;
&ldquo;now I have no hope left.&nbsp; I intended&mdash;I was just
going to tell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Cecilia,&rdquo; said Leonora, &ldquo;you need not
tell it me; I know it already; and I forgive you with all my
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can prove to you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Villars,
&ldquo;that Leonora has forgiven you.&nbsp; It is she who has
given you the prize; it was she who persuaded Louisa to give you
her vote.&nbsp; I went to see her a little while ago; and
perceiving, by her countenance, that something was the matter, I
pressed her to tell me what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, madam,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;Leonora has
made me promise to give my shell to Cecilia.&nbsp; Now I
don&rsquo;t love Cecilia half so well as I do Leonora.&nbsp;
Besides, I would not have Cecilia think I vote for her because
she gave me a Flora.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whilst Louisa was
speaking,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Villars, &ldquo;I saw this silver
box lying on the bed.&nbsp; I took it up, and asked if it was not
yours, and how she came by it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed, madam,&rsquo;
said Louisa, &lsquo;I could have been almost certain that it was
Cecilia&rsquo;s; but Leonora gave it me, and she said that she
bought it of the peddler this morning.&nbsp; If anybody else had
told me so, I could not have believed them, because I remember
the box so well; but I can&rsquo;t help believing
Leonora.&rsquo;&nbsp; But did not you ask Cecilia about it? said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, madam,&rsquo; replied Louisa; &lsquo;for
Leonora forbade me.&nbsp; I guessed her reason.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well, said I, give me the box, and I will carry your shell in it
to Cecilia.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then, madam,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;if
I must give it her, pray do take the Flora, and return it to her
first, that she may not think it is for that I do
it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, generous Louisa!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia;
&ldquo;but, indeed, Leonora, I cannot take your shell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, dear Cecilia, accept of mine instead of it! you
cannot refuse it; I only follow your example.&nbsp; As for the
bracelet,&rdquo; added Leonora, taking Cecilia&rsquo;s hand,
&ldquo;I assure you I don&rsquo;t wish for it, and you do, and
you deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cecilia, &ldquo;indeed, I do not
deserve it.&nbsp; Next to you, surely Louisa deserves it
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louisa! oh, yes, Louisa,&rdquo; exclaimed everybody
with one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Villars, &ldquo;and let Cecilia
carry the bracelet to her; she deserves that reward.&nbsp; For
one fault I cannot forget all your merits, Cecilia, nor, I am
sure, will your companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, surely, not your best friend,&rdquo; said
Leonora, kissing her.</p>
<p>Everybody present was moved.&nbsp; They looked up to Leonora
with respectful and affectionate admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Leonora, how I love you! and how I wish to be like
you!&rdquo; exclaimed Cecilia&mdash;&ldquo;to be as good, as
generous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather wish, Cecilia,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Villars,
&ldquo;to be as just; to be as strictly honourable, and as
invariably consistent.&nbsp; Remember, that many of our sex are
capable of great efforts&mdash;of making what they call great
sacrifices to virtue or to friendship; but few treat their
friends with habitual gentleness, or uniformly conduct themselves
with prudence and good sense.&rdquo;</p>

LITTLE MERCHANTS.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Chi di gallina nasce</i>, <i>convien che
rozole</i>.<br />
As the old cock crows, so crows the young.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who have visited Italy give
us an agreeable picture of the cheerful industry of the children
of all ages in the celebrated city of Naples.&nbsp; Their manner
of living and their numerous employments are exactly described in
the following &ldquo;Extract from a Traveller&rsquo;s
Journal.&rdquo; <a name="citation301"></a><a href="#footnote301"
class="citation">[301]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The children are busied in various ways.&nbsp; A great
number of them bring fish for sale to town from Santa Lucia;
others are very often seen about the arsenals, or wherever
carpenters are at work, employed in gathering up the chips and
pieces of wood; or by the sea-side, picking up sticks, and
whatever else has drifted ashore, which, when their basket is
full, they carry away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children of two or three years old, who can scarcely
crawl along upon the ground, in company with boys of five or six,
are employed in this pretty trade.&nbsp; Hence they proceed with
their baskets into the heart of the city, where in several places
they form a sort of little market, sitting round with their stock
of wood before them.&nbsp; Labourers, and the lower order of
citizens, buy it of them to burn in the tripods for warming
themselves, or to use in their scanty kitchens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other children carry about for sale the water of the
sulphurous wells, which, particularly in the spring season, is
drunk in great abundance.&nbsp; Others again endeavour to turn a
few pence by buying a small matter of fruit, of pressed honey,
cakes, and comfits, and then, like little peddlers, offer and
sell them to other children, always for no more profit than that
they may have their share of them free of expense.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really curious to see how an urchin, whose whole
stock and property consist in a board and a knife, will carry
about a water-melon, or a half roasted gourd, collect a troup of
children round him, set down his board, and proceed to divide the
fruit into small pieces among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The buyers keep a sharp look out to see that they have
enough for their little piece of copper; and the Lilliputian
tradesmen act with no less caution as the exigencies of the case
may require, to prevent his being cheated out of a
morsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The advantages of truth and honesty, and the value of a
character for integrity, are very early felt amongst these little
merchants in their daily intercourse with each other.&nbsp; The
fair dealer is always sooner or later seen to prosper.&nbsp; The
most cunning cheat is at last detected and disgraced.</p>
<p>Numerous instances of the truth of this common observation
were remarked by many Neapolitan children, especially by those
who were acquainted with the characters and history of Piedro and
Francisco, two boys originally equal in birth, fortune and
capacity, but different in their education, and consequently in
their habits and conduct.&nbsp; Francisco was the son of an
honest gardener, who, from the time he could speak, taught him to
love to speak the truth, showed him that liars are never
believed&mdash;that cheats and thieves cannot be trusted, and
that the shortest way to obtain a good character is to deserve
it.</p>
<p>Youth and white paper, as the proverb says, take all
impressions.&nbsp; The boy profited much by his father&rsquo;s
precepts, and more by his example; he always heard his father
speak the truth, and saw that he dealt fairly with
everybody.&nbsp; In all his childish traffic, Francisco,
imitating his parents, was scrupulously honest, and therefore all
his companions trusted him&mdash;&ldquo;As honest as
Francisco,&rdquo; became a sort of proverb amongst them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As honest as Francisco,&rdquo; repeated Piedro&rsquo;s
father, when he one day heard this saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let them
say so; I say, &lsquo;As sharp as Piedro&rsquo;; and let us see
which will go through the world best.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the idea
of making his son <i>sharp</i> he made him cunning.&nbsp; He
taught him, that to make a <i>good bargain</i> was to deceive as
to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of; to
get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage
of their ignorance or of their confidence.&nbsp; He often
repeated his favourite proverb&mdash;&ldquo;The buyer has need of
a hundred eyes; the seller has need but of one.&rdquo; <a
name="citation302"></a><a href="#footnote302"
class="citation">[302]</a>&nbsp; And he took frequent
opportunities of explaining the meaning of this maxim to his
son.&nbsp; He was a fisherman; and as his gains depended more
upon fortune than upon prudence, he trusted habitually to his
good luck.&nbsp; After being idle for a whole day, he would cast
his line or his nets, and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine
fish, he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the
gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are obliged to work all day long for your daily
bread,&rdquo; he would say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here; I work but
five minutes, and I have not only daily bread, but daily
fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon these occasions, our fisherman always forgot, or
neglected to count, the hours and days which were wasted in
waiting for a fair wind to put to sea, or angling in vain on the
shore.</p>
<p>Little Piedro, who used to bask in the sun upon the sea-shore
beside his father, and to lounge or sleep away his time in a
fishing-boat, acquired habits of idleness, which seemed to his
father of little consequence whilst he was <i>but a
child</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with Piedro as he grows up,
neighbour?&rdquo; said the gardener.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is smart and
quick enough, but he is always in mischief.&nbsp; Scarcely a day
has passed for this fortnight but I have caught him amongst my
grapes.&nbsp; I track his footsteps all over my
vineyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He is but a child</i> yet, and knows no
better,&rdquo; replied the fisherman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t teach him better now he is a
child, how will he know when he is a man?&rdquo; said the
gardener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty noise about a bunch of grapes, truly!&rdquo;
cried the fisherman: &ldquo;a few grapes more or less in your
vineyard, what does it signify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak for your son&rsquo;s sake, and not for the sake
of my grapes,&rdquo; said the gardener; &ldquo;and I tell you
again, the boy will not do well in the world, neighbour, if you
don&rsquo;t look after him in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do well enough in the world, you will
find,&rdquo; answered the fisherman, carelessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whenever he casts my nets, they never come up empty.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is better to be lucky than wise.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation303a"></a><a href="#footnote303a"
class="citation">[303a]</a></p>
<p>This was a proverb which Piedro had frequently heard from his
father, and to which he most willingly trusted, because it gave
him less trouble to fancy himself fortunate than to make himself
wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, child,&rdquo; said his father to him, when
he returned home after the preceding conversation with the
gardener; &ldquo;how old are you, my boy?&mdash;twelve years old,
is not it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As old as Francisco, and older by six months,&rdquo;
said Piedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And smarter and more knowing by six years,&rdquo; said
his father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, take these fish to Naples, and let
us see how you&rsquo;ll sell them for me.&nbsp; Venture a small
fish, as the proverb says, to catch a great one. <a
name="citation303b"></a><a href="#footnote303b"
class="citation">[303b]</a>&nbsp; I was too late with them at the
market yesterday, but nobody will know but what they are just
fresh out of the water, unless you go and tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I; trust me for that; I&rsquo;m not such a
fool,&rdquo; replied Piedro, laughing; &ldquo;I leave that to
Francisco.&nbsp; Do you know, I saw him the other day miss
selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to the
customer, who was just laying down the money for it, and who was
a raw servant-boy, moreover&mdash;one who would never have
guessed there were two sides to a melon, if he had not, as you
say, father, been told of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off with you to market.&nbsp; You are a droll
chap,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;and will sell my fish
cleverly, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&nbsp; As to the rest, let every
man take care of his own grapes.&nbsp; You understand me,
Piedro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said the boy, who perceived that his
father was indifferent as to his honesty, provided he sold fish
at the highest price possible.&nbsp; He proceeded to the market,
and he offered his fish with assiduity to every person whom he
thought likely to buy it, especially to those upon whom he
thought he could impose.&nbsp; He positively asserted to all who
looked at his fish, that they were just fresh out of the
water.&nbsp; Good judges of men and fish knew that he said what
was false, and passed him by with neglect; but it was at last
what he called <i>good luck</i> to meet with the very same young
raw servant-boy who would have bought the bruised melon from
Francisco.&nbsp; He made up to him directly, crying,
&ldquo;Fish!&nbsp; Fine fresh fish! fresh fish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it caught to-day?&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this morning; not an hour ago,&rdquo; said Piedro,
with the greatest effrontery.</p>
<p>The servant-boy was imposed upon; and being a foreigner,
speaking the Italian language but imperfectly, and not being
expert at reckoning the Italian money, he was no match for the
cunning Piedro, who cheated him not only as to the freshness, but
as to the price of the commodity.&nbsp; Piedro received nearly
half as much again for his fish as he ought to have done.</p>
<p>On his road homewards from Naples to the little village of
Resina, where his father lived, he overtook Francisco, who was
leading his father&rsquo;s ass.&nbsp; The ass was laden with
large panniers, which were filled with the stalks and leaves of
cauliflowers, cabbages, broccoli, lettuces, etc.&mdash;all the
refuse of the Neapolitan kitchens, which are usually collected by
the gardeners&rsquo; boys, and carried to the gardens round
Naples, to be mixed with other manure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well filled panniers, truly,&rdquo; said Piedro, as he
overtook Francisco and the ass.&nbsp; The panniers were indeed
not only filled to the top, but piled up with much skill and
care, so that the load met over the animal&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a very heavy load for the ass, though it
looks so large,&rdquo; said Francisco.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor
fellow, however, shall have a little of this water,&rdquo; added
he, leading the ass to a pool by the roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not thinking of the ass, boy; I was not thinking
of any ass, but of you, when I said, &lsquo;Well filled panniers,
truly!&rsquo;&nbsp; This is your morning&rsquo;s work, I presume,
and you&rsquo;ll make another journey to Naples to-day, on the
same errand, I warrant, before your father thinks you have done
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before <i>my father</i> thinks I have done enough,
but before I think so myself,&rdquo; replied Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do enough to satisfy myself and my father,
too,&rdquo; said Piedro, &ldquo;without slaving myself after your
fashion.&nbsp; Look here,&rdquo; producing the money he had
received for the fish; &ldquo;all this was had for asking.&nbsp;
It is no bad thing, you&rsquo;ll allow, to know how to ask for
money properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be ashamed to beg, or borrow either,&rdquo;
said Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I get what you see by begging, or borrowing
either,&rdquo; said Piedro, &ldquo;but by using my wits; not as
you did yesterday, when, like a novice, you showed the bruised
side of your melon, and so spoiled your market by your
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisdom I think it still,&rdquo; said Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father?&rdquo; asked Piedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my father,&rdquo; said Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is of a different way of thinking,&rdquo; said
Piedro.&nbsp; &ldquo;He always tells me that the buyer has need
of a hundred eyes, and if one can blind the whole hundred, so
much the better.&nbsp; You must know, I got off the fish to-day
that my father could not sell yesterday in the market&mdash;got
it off for fresh just out of the river&mdash;got twice as much as
the market price for it; and from whom, think you?&nbsp; Why,
from the very booby that would have bought the bruised melon for
a sound one if you would have let him.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll allow
I&rsquo;m no fool, Francisco, and that I&rsquo;m in a fair way to
grow rich, if I go on as I have begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Francisco; &ldquo;you forgot that the
booby you took in to-day will not be so easily taken in
to-morrow.&nbsp; He will buy no more fish from you, because he
will be afraid of your cheating him; but he will be ready enough
to buy fruit from me, because he will know I shall not cheat
him&mdash;so you&rsquo;ll have lost a customer, and I gained
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Piedro.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
customer does not make a market; if he buys no more from me, what
care I? there are people enough to buy fish in Naples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean to serve them all in the same
manner?&rdquo; asked Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they will be only so good as to give me
leave,&rdquo; said Piedro, laughing, and repeating his
father&rsquo;s proverb, &ldquo;&lsquo;Venture a small fish to
catch a large one.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation306"></a><a
href="#footnote306" class="citation">[306]</a>&nbsp; He had
learned to think that to cheat in making bargains was witty and
clever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have never considered, then,&rdquo; said
Francisco, &ldquo;that all these people will, one after another,
find you out in time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, in time; but it will be some time first.&nbsp;
There are a great many of them, enough to last me all the summer,
if I lose a customer a day,&rdquo; said Piedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next summer,&rdquo; observed Francisco, &ldquo;what
will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next summer is not come yet; there is time enough to
think what I shall do before next summer comes.&nbsp; Why, now,
suppose the blockheads, after they had been taken in and found it
out, all joined against me, and would buy none of our
fish&mdash;what then?&nbsp; Are there no trades but that of a
fisherman?&nbsp; In Naples, are there not a hundred ways of
making money for a smart lad like me? as my father says.&nbsp;
What do you think of turning merchant, and selling sugar-plums
and cakes to the children in their market?&nbsp; Would they be
hard to deal with, think you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Francisco; &ldquo;but I think
the children would find out in time if they were cheated, and
would like it as little as the men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt them.&nbsp; Then <i>in time</i> I
could, you know, change my trade&mdash;sell chips and sticks in
the wood-market&mdash;hand about the lemonade to the fine folks,
or twenty other things.&nbsp; There are trades enough,
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the honest dealer,&rdquo; said Francisco,
&ldquo;but for no other; for in all of them you&rsquo;ll find, as
<i>my</i> father says, that a good character is the best fortune
to set up with.&nbsp; Change your trade ever so often,
you&rsquo;ll be found out for what you are at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what am I, pray?&rdquo; said Piedro, angrily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The whole truth of the matter is, Francisco, that you envy
my good luck, and can&rsquo;t bear to hear this money jingle in
my hand.&nbsp; Ay, stroke the long ears of your ass, and look as
wise as you please.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better to be lucky than
wise, as <i>my</i> father says.&nbsp; Good morning to you.&nbsp;
When I am found out for what I am, or when the worst comes to the
worst, I can drive a stupid ass, with his panniers filled with
rubbish, as well as you do now, <i>honest
Francisco</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so well.&nbsp; Unless you were <i>honest
Francisco</i>, you would not fill his panniers quite so
readily.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This was certain, that Francisco was so well known for his
honesty amongst all the people at Naples with whom his father was
acquainted, that everyone was glad to deal with him; and as he
never wronged anyone, all were willing to serve him&mdash;at
least, as much as they could without loss to themselves: so that
after the market was over, his panniers were regularly filled by
the gardeners and others with whatever he wanted.&nbsp; His
industry was constant, his gains small but certain, and he every
day had more and more reason to trust to his father&rsquo;s
maxim&mdash;That honesty is the best policy.</p>
<p>The foreign servant lad, to whom Francisco had so honestly,
or, as Piedro said, so sillily, shown the bruised side of the
melon, was an Englishman.&nbsp; He left his native country, of
which he was extremely fond, to attend upon his master, to whom
he was still more attached.&nbsp; His master was in a declining
state of health, and this young lad waited on him a little more
to his mind than his other servants.&nbsp; We must, in
consideration of his zeal, fidelity and inexperience, pardon him
for not being a good judge of fish.&nbsp; Though he had
simplicity enough to be easily cheated once, he had too much
sense to be twice made a dupe.&nbsp; The next time he met Piedro
in the market, he happened to be in company with several English
gentlemen&rsquo;s servants, and he pointed Piedro out to them all
as an arrant knave.&nbsp; They heard his cry of &ldquo;Fresh
fish! fresh fish! fine fresh fish!&rdquo; with incredulous
smiles, and let him pass, but not without some expressions of
contempt, though uttered in English, he tolerably well
understood; for the tone of contempt is sufficiently expressive
in all languages.&nbsp; He lost more by not selling his fish to
these people than he had gained the day before by cheating the
<i>English booby</i>.&nbsp; The market was well supplied, and he
could not get rid of his cargo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not this truly provoking?&rdquo; said Piedro, as he
passed by Francisco, who was selling fruit for his father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look, my basket is as heavy as when I left home and look
at &rsquo;em yourself, they really are fine fresh fish to-day and
yet, because that revengeful booby told how I took him in
yesterday, not one of yonder crowd would buy them; and all the
time they really are fresh to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; said Franscisco, &ldquo;but you
said so yesterday, when they were not; and he that was duped
then, is not ready to believe you to-day.&nbsp; How does he know
that you deserve it better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have looked at the fish,&rdquo; repeated
Piedro; &ldquo;they are fresh to-day.&nbsp; I am sure he need not
have been afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Francisco; &ldquo;but as my father said
to you once&mdash;the scalded dog fears cold water.&rdquo; <a
name="citation308"></a><a href="#footnote308"
class="citation">[308]</a></p>
<p>Here their conversation was interrupted by the same English
lad, who smiled as he came up to Francisco, and taking up a fine
pine-apple, he said, in a mixture of bad Italian and
English&mdash;&ldquo;I need not look at the other side of this;
you will tell me if it is not as good as it looks. Name your
price; I know you have but one, and that an honest one; and as to
the rest, I am able and willing to pay for what I buy; that is to
say, my master is, which comes to the same thing.&nbsp; I wish
your fruit could make him well, and it would be worth its weight
in gold to me, at least.&nbsp; We must have some of your grapes
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he not well?&rdquo; inquired Francisco.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must, then, pick out the best for him,&rdquo; at the
same time singling out a tempting bunch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope he
will like these; but if you could some day come as far as Resina
(it is a village but a few miles out of town, where we have our
vineyard), you could there choose for yourself, and pluck them
fresh from the vines for your poor master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, my good boy; I should take you for an
Englishman, by your way of dealing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come to your
village.&nbsp; Only write me down the name; for your Italian
names slip through my head.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come to the vineyard
if it was ten miles off; and all the time we stay in Naples (may
it not be so long as I fear it will!), with my master&rsquo;s
leave, which he never refuses me to anything that&rsquo;s proper,
I&rsquo;ll deal with you for all our fruit, as sure as my
name&rsquo;s Arthur, and with none else, with my good will.&nbsp;
I wish all your countrymen would take after you in honesty,
indeed I do,&rdquo; concluded the Englishman, looking full at
Piedro, who took up his unsold basket of fish, looking somewhat
silly, and gloomily walked off.</p>
<p>Arthur, the English servant, was as good as his word.&nbsp; He
dealt constantly with Francisco, and proved an excellent
customer, buying from him during the whole season as much fruit
as his master wanted.&nbsp; His master, who was an Englishman of
distinction, was invited to take up his residence, during his
stay in Italy, at the Count de F.&rsquo;s villa, which was in the
environs of Naples&mdash;an easy walk from Resina.&nbsp;
Francisco had the pleasure of seeing his father&rsquo;s vineyard
often full of generous visitors, and Arthur, who had circulated
the anecdote of the bruised melon, was, he said, &ldquo;proud to
think that some of this was his doing, and that an Englishman
never forgot a good turn, be it from a countryman or
foreigner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said Francisco&rsquo;s father to
him, whilst Arthur was in the vineyard helping to tend the vines,
&ldquo;I am to thank you and your honesty, it seems, for our
having our hands so full of business this season.&nbsp; It is
fair you should have a share of our profits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have, father, enough and enough, when I see you
and mother going on so well.&nbsp; What can I want
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my brave boy, we know you are a grateful, good son;
but I have been your age myself; you have companions, you have
little expenses of your own.&nbsp; Here; this vine, this
fig-tree, and a melon a week next summer shall be yours.&nbsp;
With these make a fine figure amongst the little Neapolitan
merchants; and all I wish is that you may prosper as well, and by
the same honest means, in managing for yourself, as you have done
managing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, father; and if I prosper at all, it shall be
by those means, and no other, or I should not be worthy to be
called your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piedro the cunning did not make quite so successful a
summer&rsquo;s work as did Francisco the honest.&nbsp; No
extraordinary events happened, no singular instance of bad or
good luck occurred; but he felt, as persons usually do, the
natural consequences of his own actions.&nbsp; He pursued his
scheme of imposing, as far as he could, upon every person he
dealt with; and the consequence was, that at last nobody would
deal with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to outwit one person, but impossible to
outwit all the world,&rdquo; said a man <a
name="citation309"></a><a href="#footnote309"
class="citation">[309]</a> who knew the world at least as well as
either Piedro or his father.</p>
<p>Piedro&rsquo;s father, amongst others, had reason to
complain.&nbsp; He saw his own customers fall off from him, and
was told, whenever he went into the market, that his son was such
a cheat there was no dealing with him.&nbsp; One day, when he was
returning from the market in a very bad humour, in consequence of
these reproaches, and of his not having found customers for his
goods, he espied his <i>smart</i> son Piedro at a little
merchant&rsquo;s fruit-board devouring a fine gourd with
prodigious greediness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where, glutton, do you find
money to pay for these dainties?&rdquo; exclaimed his father,
coming close up to him, with angry gestures.&nbsp; Piedro&rsquo;s
mouth was much too full to make an immediate reply, nor did his
father wait for any, but darting his hand into the youth&rsquo;s
pocket, pulled forth a handful of silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money, father,&rdquo; said Piedro, &ldquo;that I
got for the fish yesterday, and that I meant to give you to-day,
before you went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make you remember it against another
time, sirrah!&rdquo; said his father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
teach you to fill your stomach with my money.&nbsp; Am I to lose
my customers by your tricks, and then find you here eating my
all?&nbsp; You are a rogue, and everybody has found you out to be
a rogue; and the worst of rogues I find you, who scruples not to
cheat his own father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying these words, with great vehemence he seized hold of
Piedro, and in the very midst of the little fruit-market gave him
a severe beating.&nbsp; This beating did the boy no good; it was
vengeance not punishment.&nbsp; Piedro saw that his father was in
a passion, and knew that he was beaten because he was found out
to be a rogue, rather than for being one.&nbsp; He recollected
perfectly that his father once said to him: &ldquo;Let everyone
take care of his own grapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed it was scarcely reasonable to expect that a boy who had
been educated to think that he might cheat every customer he
could in the way of trade, should be afterwards scrupulously
honest in his conduct towards the father whose proverbs
encouraged his childhood in cunning.</p>
<p>Piedro writhed with bodily pain as he left the market after
his drubbing, but his mind was not in the least amended.&nbsp; On
the contrary, he was hardened to the sense of shame by the loss
of reputation.&nbsp; All the little merchants were spectators of
this scene, and heard his father&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;You
<i>are</i> a rogue, and the worst of rogues, who scruples not to
cheat his own father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were long remembered, and long did Piedro feel
their effects.&nbsp; He once flattered himself that, when his
trade of selling fish failed him, he could readily engage in some
other; but he now found, to his mortification, that what
Francisco&rsquo;s father said proved true: &ldquo;In all trades
the best fortune to set up with is a good character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not one of the little Neapolitan merchants would either enter
into partnership with him, give him credit, or even trade with
him for ready money.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you would cheat your own
father, to be sure you will cheat us,&rdquo; was continually said
to him by these prudent little people.</p>
<p>Piedro was taunted and treated with contempt at home and
abroad.&nbsp; His father, when he found that his son&rsquo;s
smartness was no longer useful in making bargains, shoved him out
of his way whenever he met him.&nbsp; All the food or clothes
that he had at home seemed to be given to him grudgingly, and
with such expressions as these: &ldquo;Take that; but it is too
good for you.&nbsp; You must eat this, now, instead of gourds and
figs&mdash;and be thankful you have even this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piedro spent a whole winter very unhappily.&nbsp; He expected
that all his old tricks, and especially what his father had said
of him in the market-place, would be soon forgotten; but month
passed after month, and still these things were fresh in the
memory of all who had known them.</p>
<p>It is not easy to get rid of a bad character.&nbsp; A very
great rogue <a name="citation311"></a><a href="#footnote311"
class="citation">[311]</a> was once heard to say, that he would,
with all his heart, give ten thousand pounds for a good
character, because he knew that he could make twenty thousand by
it.</p>
<p>Something like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when
he experienced the evils of a bad reputation, and when he saw the
numerous advantages which Francisco&rsquo;s good character
procured.&nbsp; Such had been Piedro&rsquo;s wretched education,
that even the hard lessons of experience could not alter its
pernicious effects.&nbsp; He was sorry his knavery had been
detected, but he still thought it clever to cheat, and was
secretly persuaded that, if he had cheated successfully, he
should have been happy.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I know I am not happy
now,&rdquo; said he to himself one morning, as he sat alone
disconsolate by the sea-shore, dressed in tattered garments, weak
and hungry, with an empty basket beside him.&nbsp; His
fishing-rod, which he held between his knees, bent over the dry
sands instead of into the water, for he was not thinking of what
he was about; his arms were folded, his head hung down, and his
ragged hat was slouched over his face.&nbsp; He was a melancholy
spectacle.</p>
<p>Francisco, as he was coming from his father&rsquo;s vineyard
with a large dish of purple and white grapes upon his head, and a
basket of melons and figs hanging upon his arm, chanced to see
Piedro seated in this melancholy posture.&nbsp; Touched with
compassion, Francisco approached him softly; his footsteps were
not heard upon the sands, and Piedro did not perceive that anyone
was near him till he felt something cold touch his hand; he then
started, and, looking up, saw a bunch of grapes, which Francisco
was holding over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat them: you&rsquo;ll find them very good, I
hope,&rdquo; said Francisco, with a benevolent smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are excellent&mdash;most excellent, and I am much
obliged to you, Francisco,&rdquo; said Piedro.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
very hungry, and that&rsquo;s what I am now, without
anybody&rsquo;s caring anything about it.&nbsp; I am not the
favourite I was with my father, but I know it is all my own
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but cheer up,&rdquo; said Francisco; &ldquo;my
father always says, &lsquo;One who knows he has been in fault,
and acknowledges it, will scarcely be in fault
again.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, take as many figs as you will,&rdquo;
continued he; and held his basket closer to Piedro, who, as he
saw, cast a hungry eye upon one of the ripe figs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Piedro, after he had taken several,
&ldquo;shall not I get you into a scrape by taking so many?&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t your father be apt to miss them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would give them to you if they were not
my own?&rdquo; said Francisco, with a sudden glance of
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be angry that I asked the question;
it was only from fear of getting you into disgrace that I asked
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not be easy for anybody to do that, I
hope,&rdquo; said Francisco, rather proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to me less than anybody,&rdquo; replied Piedro, in
an insinuating tone, &ldquo;<i>I</i>, that am so much obliged to
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bunch of grapes, and a few figs, are no mighty
obligation,&rdquo; said Francisco, smiling; &ldquo;I wish I could
do more for you.&nbsp; You seem, indeed, to have been very
unhappy of late.&nbsp; We never see you in the markets as we used
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; ever since my father beat me, and called me rogue
before all the children there, I have never been able to show my
face without being gibed at by one or t&rsquo;other.&nbsp; If you
would but take me along with you amongst them, and only just
<i>seem</i> my friend, for a day or two, or so, it would quite
set me up again; for they all like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather <i>be</i> than seem your friend, if I
could,&rdquo; said Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, to be sure; that would be still better,&rdquo; said
Piedro, observing that Francisco, as he uttered his last
sentence, was separating the grapes and other fruits into two
equal divisions.&nbsp; &ldquo;To be sure I would rather you would
<i>be</i> than <i>seem</i> a friend to me; but I thought that was
too much to ask at first, though I have a notion, notwithstanding
I have been so <i>unlucky</i> lately&mdash;I have a notion you
would have no reason to repent of it.&nbsp; You would find me no
bad hand, if you were to try, and take me into
partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partnership!&rdquo; interrupted Francisco, drawing back
alarmed; &ldquo;I had no thoughts of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you? can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said
Piedro, in a supplicating tone; &ldquo;<i>can&rsquo;t</i> you
have thoughts of it?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d find me a very active
partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franscisco still drew back, and kept his eyes fixed upon the
ground.&nbsp; He was embarrassed; for he pitied Piedro, and he
scarcely knew how to point out to him that something more is
necessary in a partner in trade besides activity, and that is
honesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; repeated Piedro, thinking that
he hesitated from merely mercenary motives.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
shall have what share of the profits you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not thinking of the profits,&rdquo; said
Francisco; &ldquo;but without meaning to be ill-natured to you,
Piedro, I must say that I cannot enter into any partnership with
you at present; but I will do what, perhaps, you will like as
well,&rdquo; said he, taking half the fruit out of his basket;
&ldquo;you are heartily welcome to this; try and sell it in the
children&rsquo;s fruit market.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go on before you,
and speak to those I am acquainted with, and tell them you are
going to set up a new character, and that you hope to make it a
good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, shall I!&nbsp; Thank you for ever, dear
Francisco,&rdquo; cried Piedro, seizing his plentiful gift of
fruit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say what you please for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t make me say anything that is not
true,&rdquo; said Francisco, pausing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to be sure not,&rdquo; said Piedro; &ldquo;I
<i>do</i> mean to give no room for scandal.&nbsp; If I could get
them to trust me as they do you, I should be happy
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what you may do, if you please,&rdquo; said
Francisco.&nbsp; &ldquo;Adieu, I wish you well with all my heart;
but I must leave you now, or I shall be too late for the
market.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Chi va piano va sano</i>, <i>e anch&eacute;
lontano</i>.<br />
Fair and softly goes far in a day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Piedro</span> had now an opportunity of
establishing a good character.&nbsp; When he went into the market
with his grapes and figs, he found that he was not shunned or
taunted as usual.&nbsp; All seemed disposed to believe in his
intended reformation, and to give him a fair trial.</p>
<p>These favourable dispositions towards him were the consequence
of Francisco&rsquo;s benevolent representations.&nbsp; He told
them that he thought Piedro had suffered enough to cure him of
his tricks, and that it would be cruelty in them, because he
might once have been in fault, to banish him by their reproaches
from amongst them, and thus to prevent him from the means of
gaining his livelihood honestly.</p>
<p>Piedro made a good beginning, and gave what several of the
younger customers thought excellent bargains.&nbsp; His grapes
and figs were quickly sold, and with the money that he got for
them he the next day purchased from a fruit dealer a fresh
supply; and thus he went on for some time, conducting himself
with scrupulous honesty, so that he acquired some credit among
his companions.&nbsp; They no longer watched him with suspicious
eyes.&nbsp; They trusted to his measures and weights, and they
counted less carefully the change which they received from
him.</p>
<p>The satisfaction he felt from this alteration in their manners
was at first delightful to Piedro; but in proportion to his
credit, his opportunities of defrauding increased; and these
became temptations which he had not the firmness to resist.&nbsp;
His old manner of thinking recurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make but a few shillings a day, and this is but slow
work,&rdquo; said he to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;What signifies my
good character, if I make so little by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Light gains, and frequent, make a heavy purse, <a
name="citation314"></a><a href="#footnote314"
class="citation">[314]</a> was one of Francisco&rsquo;s
proverbs.&nbsp; But Piedro was in too great haste to get rich to
take time into his account.&nbsp; He set his invention to work,
and he did not want for ingenuity, to devise means of cheating
without running the risk of detection.&nbsp; He observed that the
younger part of the community were extremely fond of certain
coloured sugar plums, and of burnt almonds.</p>
<p>With the money he had earned by two months&rsquo; trading in
fruit he laid in a large stock of what appeared to these little
merchants a stock of almonds and sugar-plums, and he painted in
capital gold coloured letters upon his board, &ldquo;Sweetest,
largest, most admirable sugar-plums of all colours ever sold in
Naples, to be had here; and in gratitude to his numerous
customers, Piedro adds to these, &lsquo;Burnt almonds
gratis.&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This advertisement attracted the attention of all who could
read; and many who could not read heard it repeated with
delight.&nbsp; Crowds of children surrounded Piedro&rsquo;s board
of promise, and they all went away the first day amply
satisfied.&nbsp; Each had a full measure of coloured sugar-plums
at the usual price, and along with these a burnt almond
gratis.&nbsp; The burnt almond had such an effect upon the public
judgment, that it was universally allowed that the sugar-plums
were, as the advertisement set forth, the largest, sweetest, most
admirable ever sold in Naples; though all the time they were, in
no respect, better than any other sugar-plums.</p>
<p>It was generally reported that Piedro gave full
measure&mdash;fuller than any other board in the city.&nbsp; He
measured the sugar-plums in a little cubical tin box; and this,
it was affirmed, he heaped up to the top, and pressed down before
he poured out the contents into the open hands of his approving
customers.&nbsp; This belief, and Piedro&rsquo;s popularity,
continued longer even than he had expected; and, as he thought
his sugar-plums had secured their reputation with the <i>generous
public</i>, he gradually neglected to add burnt almonds
gratis.</p>
<p>One day a boy of about ten years old passed carelessly by,
whistling as he went along, and swinging a carpenter&rsquo;s rule
in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! what have we here?&rdquo; cried he,
stopping to read what was written on Piedro&rsquo;s board.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This promises rarely.&nbsp; Old as I am, and tall of my
age, which makes the matter worse, I am still as fond of
sugar-plums as my little sister, who is five years younger than
I.&nbsp; Come, Signor, fill me quick, for I&rsquo;m in haste to
taste them, two measures of the sweetest, largest, most admirable
sugar-plums in Naples&mdash;one measure for myself and one for my
little Rosetta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for yourself and your sister,
then,&rdquo; said Piedro, &ldquo;for no credit is given
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No credit do I ask,&rdquo; replied the lively boy;
&ldquo;when I told you I loved sugar-plums, did I tell you I
loved them, or even my sister, so well as to run in debt for
them?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s for myself, and here&rsquo;s for my
sister&rsquo;s share,&rdquo; said he, laying down his money;
&ldquo;and now for the burnt almonds gratis, my good
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all out; I have been out of burnt almonds this
great while,&rdquo; said Piedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are they in your advertisement here?&rdquo;
said Carlo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not had time to scratch them out of the
board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! not when you have, by your own account, been out
of them a great while?&nbsp; I did not know it required so much
time to blot out a few words&mdash;let us try&rdquo;; and as he
spoke, Carlo, for that was the name of Piedro&rsquo;s new
customer, pulled a bit of white chalk out of his pocket, and drew
a broad score across the line on the board which promised burnt
almonds gratis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are most impatient,&rdquo; said Piedro; &ldquo;I
shall have a fresh stock of almonds to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why must the board tell a lie to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would ruin me to alter it,&rdquo; said Piedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lie may ruin you, but I could scarcely think the
truth could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to meddle with me or my board,&rdquo;
said Piedro, put off his guard, and out of his usual soft voice
of civility, by this last observation.&nbsp; &ldquo;My character,
and that of my board, are too firmly established now for any
chance customer like you to injure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else,&rdquo;
said Carlo&mdash;&ldquo;I wish, moreover, you may not injure
yourself.&nbsp; Do as you please with your board, but give me my
sugar-plums, for I have some right to meddle with those, having
paid for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold out your hand, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, put them in here, if you please; put my
sister&rsquo;s, at least, in here; she likes to have them in this
box: I bought some for her in it yesterday, and she&rsquo;ll
think they&rsquo;ll taste the better out of the same box.&nbsp;
But how is this? your measure does not fill my box nearly; you
give us very few sugar-plums for our money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you full measure, as I give to
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The measure should be an inch cube, I know,&rdquo; said
Carlo; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what all the little merchants have
agreed to, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Piedro, &ldquo;so it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it is, I must allow,&rdquo; said Carlo,
measuring the outside of it with the carpenter&rsquo;s rule which
he held in his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;An inch every way; and yet by
my eye&mdash;and I have no bad one, being used to measuring
carpenter&rsquo;s work for my father&mdash;by my eye I should
think this would have held more sugar-plums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eye often deceives us;&rdquo; said Piedro.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like measuring, you find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like measuring, I find,
indeed,&rdquo; replied Carlo, as he looked closely at the end of
his rule, which, since he spoke last, he had put into the cube to
take its depth in the inside.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is not as deep by
a quarter of an inch, Signor Piedro, measured within as it is
measured without.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piedro changed colour terribly, and seizing hold of the tin
box, endeavoured to wrest it from the youth who measured so
accurately.&nbsp; Carlo held his prize fast, and lifting it above
his head, he ran into the midst of the square where the little
market was held, exclaiming, &ldquo;A discovery! a discovery!
that concerns all who love sugar-plums.&nbsp; A discovery! a
discovery that concerns all who have ever bought the sweetest,
and most admirable sugar-plums ever sold in Naples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd gathered from all parts of the square as he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have bought,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We have bought of
those sugar-plums,&rdquo; cried several little voices at once,
&ldquo;if you mean Piedro&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; continued Carlo&mdash;&ldquo;he who,
out of gratitude to his numerous customers, gives, or promises to
give, burnt almonds gratis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent they were!&rdquo; cried several voices.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We all know Piedro well; but what&rsquo;s your
discovery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My discovery is,&rdquo; said Carlo, &ldquo;that you,
none of you, know Piedro.&nbsp; Look you here; look at this
box&mdash;this is his measure; it has a false bottom&mdash;it
holds only three-quarters as much as it ought to do; and his
numerous customers have all been cheated of one-quarter of every
measure of the admirable sugar-plums they have bought from
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Think twice of a good bargain,&rsquo; says the
proverb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we have been finely duped, indeed,&rdquo; cried some
of the bystanders, looking at one another with a mortified
air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Full of courtesy, full of craft!&rdquo; <a
name="citation317"></a><a href="#footnote317"
class="citation">[317]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;So this is the meaning of
his burnt almonds gratis,&rdquo; cried others; all joined in an
uproar of indignation, except one, who, as he stood behind the
rest, expressed in his countenance silent surprise and
sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Piedro a relation of yours?&rdquo; said Carlo,
going up to this silent person.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry, if he
be, that I have published his disgrace, for I would not hurt
<i>you</i>.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t sell sugar-plums as he does,
I&rsquo;m sure; for my little sister Rosetta has often bought
from you.&nbsp; Can this Piedro be a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to have been his friend; but I see I
can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Francisco.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a
neighbour of ours, and I pitied him; but since he is at his old
tricks again, there&rsquo;s an end of the matter.&nbsp; I have
reason to be obliged to you, for I was nearly taken in.&nbsp; He
has behaved so well for some time past, that I intended this very
evening to have gone to him, and to have told him that I was
willing to do for him what he has long begged of me to
do&mdash;to enter into partnership with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francisco! Francisco!&mdash;your measure, lend us your
measure!&rdquo; exclaimed a number of little merchants crowding
round him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have a measure for sugar-plums; and
we have all agreed to refer to that, and to see how much we have
been cheated before we go to break Piedro&rsquo;s bench and
declare him bankrupt, <a name="citation318"></a><a
href="#footnote318" class="citation">[318]</a>&mdash;the
punishment for all knaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pressed on to Francisco&rsquo;s board, obtained his
measure, found that it held something more than a quarter above
the quantity that could be contained in Piedro&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
cries of the enraged populace were now most clamorous.&nbsp; They
hung the just and the unjust measures upon high poles; and,
forming themselves into a formidable phalanx, they proceeded
towards Piedro&rsquo;s well known yellow lettered board,
exclaiming, as they went along, &ldquo;Common cause! common
cause!&nbsp; The little Neapolitan merchants will have no knaves
amongst them!&nbsp; Break his bench! break his bench!&nbsp; He is
a bankrupt in honesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piedro saw the mob, heard the indignant clamour, and,
terrified at the approach of numbers, he fled with the utmost
precipitation, having scarcely time to pack up half his
sugar-plums.&nbsp; There was a prodigious number, more than would
have filled many honest measures, scattered upon the ground and
trampled under foot by the crowd.&nbsp; Piedro&rsquo;s bench was
broken, and the public vengeance wreaked itself also upon his
treacherous painted board.&nbsp; It was, after being much
disfigured by various inscriptions expressive of the universal
contempt for Piedro, hung up in a conspicuous part of the
market-place; and the false measure was fastened like a cap upon
one of its corners.&nbsp; Piedro could never more show his face
in this market, and all hopes of friendship&mdash;all hopes of
partnership with Francisco&mdash;were for ever at an end.</p>
<p>If rogues would calculate, they would cease to be rogues; for
they would certainly discover that it is most for their interest
to be honest&mdash;setting aside the pleasure of being esteemed
and beloved, of having a safe conscience, with perfect freedom
from all the various embarrassments and terror to which knaves
are subject.&nbsp; Is it not clear that our crafty hero would
have gained rather more by a partnership with Francisco, and by a
fair character, than he could possibly obtain by fraudulent
dealing in comfits?</p>
<p>When the mob had dispersed, after satisfying themselves with
executing summary justice upon Piedro&rsquo;s bench and board,
Francisco found a carpenter&rsquo;s rule lying upon the ground
near Piedro&rsquo;s broken bench, which he recollected to have
seen in the hands of Carlo.&nbsp; He examined it carefully, and
he found Carlo&rsquo;s name written upon it, and the name of the
street where he lived; and though it was considerably out of his
way, he set out immediately to restore the rule, which was a very
handsome one, to its rightful owner.&nbsp; After a hot walk
through several streets, he overtook Carlo, who had just reached
the door of his own house.&nbsp; Carlo was particularly obliged
to him, he said, for restoring this rule to him, as it was a
present from the master of a vessel, who employed his father to
do carpenter&rsquo;s work for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;One should not
praise one&rsquo;s self, they say,&rdquo; continued Carlo,
&ldquo;but I long so much to gain your good opinion, that I must
tell you the whole history of the rule you have restored.&nbsp;
It was given to me for having measured the work and made up the
bill of a whole pleasure-boat myself.&nbsp; You may guess I
should have been sorry enough to have lost it.&nbsp; Thank you
for its being once more in my careless hands, and tell me, I beg,
whenever I can do you any service.&nbsp; By-the-by, I can make up
for you a fruit stall.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do it to-morrow, and it
shall be the admiration of the market.&nbsp; Is there anything
else you could think of for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Francisco; &ldquo;since you are
so good-natured, perhaps you&rsquo;d be kind enough to tell me
the meaning of some of those lines and figures that I see upon
your rule.&nbsp; I have a great curiosity to know their
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;ll explain to you with pleasure, as far as
I know them myself; but when I&rsquo;m at fault, my father, who
is cleverer than I am, and understands trigonometry, can help us
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trigonometry!&rdquo; repeated Francisco, not a little
alarmed at the high sounding word; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I
certainly shall never understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never fear,&rdquo; replied Carlo, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I looked just as you do now&mdash;I felt just as you do
now&mdash;all in a fright and a puzzle, when I first heard of
angles and sines, and cosines, and arcs and centres, and
complements and tangents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mercy! mercy!&rdquo; interrupted Francisco, whilst
Carlo laughed, with a benevolent sense of superiority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Carlo, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find all
these things are nothing when you are used to them.&nbsp; But I
cannot explain my rule to you here broiling in the sun.&nbsp;
Besides, it will not be the work of a day, I promise you; but
come and see us at your leisure hours, and we&rsquo;ll study it
together.&nbsp; I have a great notion we shall become friends;
and, to begin, step in with me now,&rdquo; said Carlo, &ldquo;and
eat a little macaroni with us.&nbsp; I know it is ready by this
time.&nbsp; Besides, you&rsquo;ll see my father, and he&rsquo;ll
show you plenty of rules and compasses, as you like such things;
and then I&rsquo;ll go home with you in the cool of the evening,
and you shall show me your melons and vines, and teach me, in
time, something of gardening.&nbsp; Oh, I see we must be good
friends, just made for each other; so come in&mdash;no
ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlo was not mistaken in his predictions; he and Francisco
became very good friends, spent all their leisure hours together,
either in Carlo&rsquo;s workshop or in Francisco&rsquo;s
vineyard, and they mutually improved each other.&nbsp; Francisco,
before he saw his friend&rsquo;s rule, knew but just enough of
arithmetic to calculate in his head the price of the fruit which
he sold in the market; but with Carlo&rsquo;s assistance, and the
ambition to understand the tables and figures upon the wonderful
rule, he set to work in earnest, and in due time, satisfied both
himself and his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows but these things that I am learning now may
be of some use to me before I die?&rdquo; said Francisco, as he
was sitting one morning with his tutor, the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure it will,&rdquo; said the carpenter, putting
down his compasses, with which he was drawing a
circle&mdash;&ldquo;Arithmetic is a most useful, and I was going
to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations; and a
little trigonometry does no harm.&nbsp; In short, my maxim is,
that no knowledge comes amiss; for a man&rsquo;s head is of as
much use to him as his hands; and even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">&ldquo;A word to the
wise will always suffice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, to say nothing of making a fortune, is not
there a great pleasure in being something of a scholar, and being
able to pass one&rsquo;s time with one&rsquo;s book, and
one&rsquo;s compasses and pencil?&nbsp; Safe companions these for
young and old.&nbsp; No one gets into mischief that has pleasant
things to think of and to do when alone; and I know, for my part,
that trigonometry is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the carpenter, just as he was going to pronounce a fresh
panegyric upon his favourite trigonometry, was interrupted by the
sudden entrance of his little daughter Rosetta, all in tears: a
very unusual spectacle, for, taking the year round, she shed
fewer tears than any child of her age in Naples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear good humoured little Rosetta, what has
happened?&nbsp; Why these large tears?&rdquo; said her brother
Carlo, and he went up to her, and wiped them from her
cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;And these that are going over the bridge of
the nose so fast?&nbsp; I must stop these tears, too,&rdquo; said
Carlo.</p>
<p>Rosetta, at this speech, burst out laughing, and said that she
did not know till then that she had any bridge on her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were these shells the cause of the tears?&rdquo;
said her brother, looking at a heap of shells, which she held
before her in her frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, partly,&rdquo; said Rosetta.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
partly my own fault, but not all.&nbsp; You know I went out to
the carpenter&rsquo;s yard, near the arsenal, where all the
children are picking up chips and sticks so busily; and I was as
busy as any of them, because I wanted to fill my basket soon; and
then I thought I should sell my basketful directly in the little
wood-market.&nbsp; As soon as I had filled my basket, and made up
my faggot (which was not done, brother, till I was almost baked
by the sun, for I was forced to wait by the carpenters for the
bits of wood to make up my faggot)&mdash;I say, when it was all
ready, and my basket full, I left it altogether in the
yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not wise to leave it,&rdquo; said Carlo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I only left it for a few minutes, brother, and I
could not think anybody would be so dishonest as to take it
whilst I was away.&nbsp; I only just ran to tell a boy, who had
picked up all these beautiful shells upon the sea-shore, and who
wanted to sell them, that I should be glad to buy them from him,
if he would only be so good as to keep them for me, for an hour
or so, till I had carried my wood to market, and till I had sold
it, and so had money to pay him for the shells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your heart was set mightily on these shells,
Rosetta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; for I thought you and Francisco, brother, would
like to have them for your nice grotto that you are making at
Resina.&nbsp; That was the reason I was in such a hurry to get
them.&nbsp; The boy who had them to sell was very good-natured;
he poured them into my lap, and said I had such an honest face he
would trust me, and that as he was in a great hurry, he could not
wait an hour whilst I sold my wood; but that he was sure I would
pay him in the evening, and he told me that he would call here
this evening for the money.&nbsp; But now what shall I do,
Carlo?&nbsp; I shall have no money to give him: I must give back
his shells, and that&rsquo;s a great pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how happened it that you did not sell your
wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot; did not I tell you that?&nbsp; When I
went for my basket, do you know it was empty, quite empty, not a
chip left?&nbsp; Some dishonest person had carried it all
off.&nbsp; Had not I reason to cry now, Carlo?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go this minute into the wood-market, and see
if I can find your faggot.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t that be better than
crying?&rdquo; said her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should you know any
one of your pieces of wood again if you were to see
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one of them, I am sure, I should know
again,&rdquo; said Rosetta.&nbsp; &ldquo;It had a notch at one
end of it, where one of the carpenters cut it off from another
piece of wood for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut
it still to be seen?&rdquo; said Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is in the yard; but I cannot bring it to you,
for it is very heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go to it,&rdquo; said Francisco, &ldquo;and I
hope we shall recover your basketful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlo and his friend went with Rosetta immediately to the
yard, near the arsenal, saw the notched piece of wood, and then
proceeded to the little wood-market, and searched every heap that
lay before the little factors; but no notched bit was to be
found, and Rosetta declared that she did not see one stick that
looked at all like any of hers.</p>
<p>On their part, her companions eagerly untied their faggots to
show them to her, and exclaimed, &ldquo;That they were incapable
of taking what did not belong to them; that of all persons they
should never have thought of taking anything from the good
natured little Rosetta, who was always ready to give to others,
and to help them in making up their loads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despairing of discovering the thief, Francisco and Carlo left
the market.&nbsp; As they were returning home, they were met by
the English servant Arthur, who asked Francisco where he had
been, and where he was going.</p>
<p>As soon as he heard of Rosetta&rsquo;s lost faggot, and of the
bit of wood, notched at one end, of which Rosetta drew the shape
with a piece of chalk, which her brother had lent her, Arthur
exclaimed, &ldquo;I have seen such a bit of wood as this within
this quarter of an hour; but I cannot recollect where.&nbsp;
Stay! this was at the baker&rsquo;s, I think, where I went for
some rolls for my master.&nbsp; It was lying beside his
oven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the baker&rsquo;s they all went as fast as possible, and
they got there but just in time.&nbsp; The baker had in his hand
the bit of wood with which he was that instant going to feed his
oven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, good Mr. Baker!&rdquo; cried Rosetta, who ran
into the baker&rsquo;s shop first; and as he heard &ldquo;Stop!
stop!&rdquo; re-echoed by many voices, the baker stopped; and
turning to Francisco, Carlo and Arthur, begged, with a
countenance of some surprise, to know why they had desired him to
stop.</p>
<p>The case was easily explained, and the baker told them that he
did not buy any wood in the little market that morning; that this
faggot he had purchased between the hours of twelve and one from
a lad about Francisco&rsquo;s height, whom he met near the yard
of the arsenal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my bit of wood, I am sure; I know it by this
notch,&rdquo; said Rosetta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the baker, &ldquo;if you will stay
here a few minutes, you will probably see the lad who sold it to
me.&nbsp; He desired to be paid in bread, and my bread was not
quite baked when he was here.&nbsp; I bid him call again in an
hour, and I fancy he will be pretty punctual, for he looked
desperately hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baker had scarcely finished speaking when Francisco, who
was standing watching at the door, exclaimed, &ldquo;Here comes
Piedro!&nbsp; I hope he is not the boy who sold you the wood, Mr.
Baker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the boy, though,&rdquo; replied the baker, and
Piedro, who now entered the shop, started at the sight of Carlo
and Francisco, whom he had never seen since the day of disgrace
in the fruit-market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your servant, Signor Piedro,&rdquo; said Carlo;
&ldquo;I have the honour to tell you that this piece of wood, and
all that you took out of the basket, which you found in the yard
of the arsenal, belongs to my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; cried Rosetta.</p>
<p>Piedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied
Rosetta&rsquo;s basket, and imagining that he was suspected only
upon the bare assertion of a child like Rosetta, who might be
baffled and frightened out of her story, boldly denied the
charge, and defied any one to prove him guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a right to be heard in his own defence,&rdquo;
said Arthur, with the cool justice of an Englishman; and he
stopped the angry Carlo&rsquo;s arm, who was going up to the
culprit with all the Italian vehemence of oratory and
gesture.&nbsp; Arthur went on to say something in bad Italian
about the excellence of an English trial by jury, which Carlo was
too much enraged to hear, but to which Francisco paid attention,
and turning to Piedro, he asked him if he was willing to be
judged by twelve of his equals?</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Piedro, still
maintaining an unmoved countenance, and they returned immediately
to the little wood-market.&nbsp; On their way, they had passed
through the fruit-market, and crowds of those who were well
acquainted with Piedro&rsquo;s former transactions followed, to
hear the event of the present trial.</p>
<p>Arthur could not, especially as he spoke wretched Italian,
make the eager little merchants understand the nature and
advantages of an English trial by jury.&nbsp; They preferred
their own summary mode of proceeding.&nbsp; Francisco, in whose
integrity they all had perfect confidence, was chosen with
unanimous shouts for the judge; but he declined the office, and
another was appointed.&nbsp; He was raised upon a bench, and the
guilty but insolent looking Piedro, and the ingenuous, modest
Rosetta stood before him.&nbsp; She made her complaint in a very
artless manner; and Piedro, with ingenuity, which in a better
cause would have deserved admiration, spoke volubly and craftily
in his own defence.&nbsp; But all that he could say could not
alter facts.&nbsp; The judge compared the notched bit of wood
found at the baker&rsquo;s with a piece from which it was cut,
which he went to see in the yard of the arsenal.&nbsp; It was
found to fit exactly.&nbsp; The judge then found it impossible to
restrain the loud indignation of all the spectators.&nbsp; The
prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market; and
the moment sentence was pronounced, Piedro was hissed and hooted
out of the market-place.&nbsp; Thus a third time he deprived
himself of the means of earning his bread.</p>
<p>We shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in
the trades he next attempted.&nbsp; He handed lemonade about in a
part of Naples where he was not known, but he lost his customers
by putting too much water and too little lemon into this
beverage.&nbsp; He then took to the waters from the sulphurous
springs, and served them about to foreigners; but one day, as he
was trying to jostle a competitor from the coach door, he slipped
his foot, and broke his glasses.&nbsp; They had been borrowed
from an old woman, who hired out glasses to the boys who sold
lemonade.&nbsp; Piedro knew that it was the custom to pay, of
course, for all that was broken; but this he was not inclined to
do.&nbsp; He had a few shillings in his pocket, and thought that
it would be very clever to defraud this poor woman of her right,
and to spend his shillings upon what he valued much more than he
did his good name&mdash;macaroni.&nbsp; The shillings were soon
gone.</p>
<p>We shall now for the present leave Piedro to his follies and
his fate; or, to speak more properly, to his follies and their
inevitable consequences.</p>
<p>Francisco was all this time acquiring knowledge from his new
friends, without neglecting his own or his father&rsquo;s
business.&nbsp; He contrived, during the course of autumn and
winter, to make himself a tolerable arithmetician.&nbsp;
Carlo&rsquo;s father could draw plans in architecture neatly; and
pleased with the eagerness Francisco showed to receive
instruction, he willingly put a pencil and compasses into his
hand, and taught him all he knew himself.&nbsp; Francisco had
great perseverance, and, by repeated trials, he at length
succeeded in copying exactly all the plans which his master lent
him.&nbsp; His copies, in time, surpassed the originals, and
Carlo exclaimed, with astonishment: &ldquo;Why, Francisco, what
an astonishing <i>genius</i> you have for
drawing!&mdash;Absolutely you draw plans better than my
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to genius,&rdquo; said Francisco, honestly, &ldquo;I
have none.&nbsp; All that I have done has been done by hard
labour.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how other people do things; but
I am sure that I never have been able to get anything done well
but by patience.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember, Carlo, how you
and even Rosetta laughed at me the first time your father put a
pencil into my awkward, clumsy hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Carlo, laughing again at the
recollection, &ldquo;you held your pencil so drolly; and when you
were to cut it, you cut it just as if you were using a
pruning-knife to your vines; but now it is your turn to laugh,
for you surpass us all.&nbsp; And the times are changed since I
set about to explain this rule of mine to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that rule,&rdquo; said Francisco&mdash;&ldquo;how
much I owe to it!&nbsp; Some great people, when they lose any of
their fine things, cause the crier to promise a reward of so much
money to anyone who shall find and restore their trinket.&nbsp;
How richly have you and your father rewarded me for returning
this rule!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francisco&rsquo;s modesty and gratitude, as they were
perfectly sincere, attached his friends to him most powerfully;
but there was one person who regretted our hero&rsquo;s frequent
absences from his vineyard at Resina.&nbsp; Not Francisco&rsquo;s
father, for he was well satisfied his son never neglected his
business; and as to the hours spent in Naples, he had so much
confidence in Francisco that he felt no apprehensions of his
getting into bad company.&nbsp; When his son had once said to
him, &ldquo;I spend my time at such a place, and in such and such
a manner,&rdquo; he was as well convinced of its being so as if
he had watched and seen him every moment of the day.&nbsp; But it
was Arthur who complained of Francisco&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, because I am an Englishman,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t value my friendship, and yet that is the
very reason you ought to value it; no friends so good as the
English, be it spoken without offence to your Italian friend, for
whom you now continually leave me to dodge up and down here in
Resina, without a soul that I like to speak to, for you are the
only Italian I ever liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall like another, I promise you,&rdquo; said
Francisco.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must come with me to Carlo&rsquo;s,
and see how I spend my evenings; then complain of me, if you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the utmost stretch of Arthur&rsquo;s complaisance to
pay this visit; but, in spite of his national prejudices and
habitual reserve of temper, he was pleased with the reception he
met with from the generous Carlo and the playful Rosetta.&nbsp;
They showed him Francisco&rsquo;s drawings with enthusiastic
eagerness; and Arthur, though no great judge of drawing, was in
astonishment, and frequently repeated, &ldquo;I know a gentleman
who visits my master who would like these things.&nbsp; I wish I
might have them to show him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them, then,&rdquo; said Carlo; &ldquo;I wish all
Naples could see them, provided they might be liked half as well
as I like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur carried off the drawings, and one day, when his master
was better than usual, and when he was at leisure, eating a
dessert of Francisco&rsquo;s grapes, he entered respectfully,
with his little portfolio under his arm, and begged permission to
show his master a few drawings done by the gardener&rsquo;s son,
whose grapes he was eating.</p>
<p>Though not quite so partial a judge as the enthusiastic Carlo,
this gentleman was both pleased and surprised at the sight of
these drawings, considering how short a time Francisco had
applied himself to this art, and what slight instructions he had
received.&nbsp; Arthur was desired to summon the young
artist.&nbsp; Francisco&rsquo;s honest, open manner, joined to
the proofs he had given of his abilities, and the character
Arthur gave him for strict honesty, and constant kindness to his
parents, interested Mr. Lee, the name of this English gentleman,
much in his favour.&nbsp; Mr. Lee was at this time in treaty with
an Italian painter, whom he wished to engage to copy for him
exactly some of the cornices, mouldings, tablets, and antique
ornaments which are to be seen amongst the ruins of the ancient
city of Herculaneum. <a name="citation326"></a><a

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Tutte le gran faciende si fanno di poca
cosa</i>.<br />
What great events from trivial causes spring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Signor Camillo</span>, the artist employed
by Mr. Lee to copy some of the antique ornaments in Herculaneum,
was a liberal minded man, perfectly free from that mean jealousy
which would repress the efforts of rising genius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a lad scarcely fifteen, a poor gardener&rsquo;s
son, who, with merely the instructions he could obtain from a
common carpenter, has learned to draw these plans and elevations,
which you see are tolerably neat.&nbsp; What an advantage your
instruction would be to him,&rdquo; said Mr. Lee, as he
introduced Francisco to Signor Camillo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
interested in this lad from what I have learned of his good
conduct.&nbsp; I hear he is strictly honest, and one of the best
of sons.&nbsp; Let us do something for him.&nbsp; If you will
give him some knowledge of your art, I will, as far as money can
recompense you for your loss of time, pay whatever you may think
reasonable for his instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Signor Camillo made no difficulties; he was pleased with his
pupil&rsquo;s appearance, and every day he liked him better and
better.&nbsp; In the room where they worked together there were
some large books of drawings and plates, which Francisco saw now
and then opened by his master, and which he had a great desire to
look over; but when he was left in the room by himself he never
touched them, because he had not permission.&nbsp; Signor
Camillo, the first day he came into this room with his pupil,
said to him, &ldquo;Here are many valuable books and drawings,
young man.&nbsp; I trust, from the character I have heard of you,
that they will be perfectly safe here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some weeks after Francisco had been with the painter, they had
occasion to look for the front of a temple in one of these large
books.&nbsp; &ldquo;What! don&rsquo;t you know in which book to
look for it, Francisco?&rdquo; cried his master, with some
impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it possible that you have been here
so long with these books, and that you cannot find the print I
mean?&nbsp; Had you half the taste I gave you credit for, you
would have singled it out from all the rest, and have it fixed in
your memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, signor, I never saw it,&rdquo; said Francisco,
respectfully, &ldquo;or, perhaps, I should have preferred
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you never saw it, young man, is the very thing of
which I complain.&nbsp; Is a taste for the arts to be learned,
think you, by looking at the cover of a book like this?&nbsp; Is
it possible that you never thought of opening it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often and often,&rdquo; cried Francisco, &ldquo;have I
longed to open it; but I thought it was forbidden me, and however
great my curiosity in your absence, I have never touched
them.&nbsp; I hoped indeed, that the time would come when you
would have the goodness to show them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so the time is come, excellent young man,&rdquo;
cried Camillo; &ldquo;much as I love taste, I love integrity
more.&nbsp; I am now sure of your having the one, and let me see
whether you have, as I believe you have, the other.&nbsp; Sit you
down here beside me; and we will look over these books
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attention with which his young pupil examined everything,
and the pleasure he unaffectedly expressed in seeing these
excellent prints, sufficiently convinced his judicious master
that it was not from the want of curiosity or taste that he had
never opened these tempting volumes.&nbsp; His confidence in
Francisco was much increased by this circumstance, slight as it
may appear.</p>
<p>One day, Signor Camillo came behind Francisco, as he was
drawing with much intentness, and tapping him upon the shoulder,
he said to him: &ldquo;Put up your pencils and follow me, I can
depend upon your integrity; I have pledged myself for it.&nbsp;
Bring your note-book with you, and follow me; I will this day
show you something that will entertain you at least as much as my
large book of prints.&nbsp; Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francisco followed, till they came to the pit near the
entrance of Herculaneum.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have obtained leave for
you to accompany me,&rdquo; said his master, &ldquo;and you know,
I suppose, that this is not a permission granted to
everyone?&rdquo;&nbsp; Paintings of great value, besides
ornaments of gold and silver, antique bracelets, rings, etc., are
from time to time found amongst these ruins, and therefore it is
necessary that no person should be admitted whose honesty cannot
be depended upon.&nbsp; Thus, even Francisco&rsquo;s talents
could not have advanced him in the world, unless they had been
united to integrity.&nbsp; He was much delighted and astonished
by the new scene that was now opened to his view; and as, day
after day, he accompanied his master to this subterraneous city,
he had leisure for observation.&nbsp; He was employed, as soon as
he had gratified his curiosity, in drawing.&nbsp; There are
niches in the walls in several places, from which pictures have
been dug, and these niches are often adorned with elegant
masques, figures and animals, which have been left by the
ignorant or careless workmen, and which are going fast to
destruction.&nbsp; Signor Camillo, who was copying these for his
English employer, had a mind to try his pupil&rsquo;s skill, and,
pointing to a niche bordered with grotesque figures, he desired
him to try if he could make any hand of it.&nbsp; Francisco made
several trials, and at last finished such an excellent copy, that
his enthusiastic and generous master, with warm encomiums,
carried it immediately to his patron, and he had the pleasure to
receive from Mr. Lee a purse containing five guineas, as a reward
and encouragement for his pupil.</p>
<p>Francisco had no sooner received this money, than he hurried
to his father and mother&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; His mother, some
months before this time, had taken a small dairy farm; and her
son had once heard her express a wish that she was but rich
enough to purchase a remarkably fine brindled cow, which belonged
to a farmer in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, my dear mother,&rdquo; cried Francisco, pouring
the guineas into her lap; &ldquo;and here,&rdquo; continued he,
emptying a bag which contained about as much more, in small
Italian coins, the profits of trade-money he had fairly earned
during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little Neapolitan
merchants; &ldquo;this is all yours, dearest mother, and I hope
it will be enough to pay for the brindled cow.&nbsp; Nay, you
must not refuse me&mdash;I have set my heart upon the cow being
milked by you this very evening; and I&rsquo;ll produce my best
bunches of grapes, and my father, perhaps, will give us a melon;
for I&rsquo;ve had no time for melons this season; and I&rsquo;ll
step to Naples and invite&mdash;may I, mother?&mdash;my good
friends, dear Carlo and your favourite little Rosetta, and my old
drawing master, and my friend Arthur, and we&rsquo;ll sup with
you at your dairy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The happy mother thanked her son, and the father assured him
that neither melon nor pine-apple should be spared, to make a
supper worthy of his friends.</p>
<p>The brindled cow was bought, and Arthur and Carlo and Rosetta
most joyfully accepted their invitation.</p>
<p>The carpenter had unluckily appointed to settle a long account
that day with one of his employers, and he could not accompany
his children.&nbsp; It was a delicious evening; they left Naples
just as the sea-breeze, after the heats of the day, was most
refreshingly felt.&nbsp; The walk to Resina, the vineyard, the
dairy, and most of all, the brindled cow, were praised by Carlo
and Rosetta, with all the Italian superlatives which signify,
&ldquo;Most beautiful! most delightful! most
charming!&rdquo;&nbsp; Whilst the English Arthur, with as warm a
heart, was more temperate in his praise, declaring that this was
&ldquo;the most like an English summer&rsquo;s evening of any he
had ever felt since he came to Italy: and that, moreover, the
cream was almost as good as what he had been used to drink in
Cheshire.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company, who were all pleased with
each other, and with the gardener&rsquo;s good fruit, which he
produced in great abundance, did not think of separating till
late.</p>
<p>It was a bright moonlight night, and Carlo asked his friend if
he would walk with them part of the way to Naples.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, all the way most willingly,&rdquo; cried Francisco,
&ldquo;that I may have the pleasure of giving to your father,
with my own hands, this fine bunch of grapes, that I have
reserved for him out of my own share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Add this fine pine-apple for my share, then,&rdquo;
said his father, &ldquo;and a pleasant walk to you, my young
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They proceeded gaily along, and when they reached Naples, as
they passed through the square where the little merchants held
their market, Francisco pointed to the spot where he found
Carlo&rsquo;s rule.&nbsp; He never missed an opportunity of
showing his friends that he did not forget their former kindness
to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;That rule,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has been
the cause of all my present happiness, and I thank you
for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind thanking him now,&rdquo; interrupted
Rosetta, &ldquo;but look yonder, and tell me what all those
people are about.&rdquo;&nbsp; She pointed to a group of men,
women and children, who were assembled under a piazza, listening
in various attitudes of attention to a man, who was standing upon
a flight of steps speaking in a loud voice, and with much action,
to the people who surrounded him.&nbsp; Francisco, Carlo and
Rosetta joined his audience.&nbsp; The moon shone full upon his
countenance, which was very expressive and which varied
frequently according to the characters of the persons whose
history he was telling, according to all the changes of their
fortune.&nbsp; This man was one of those who are called
Improvisatori&mdash;persons who, in Italian towns, go about
reciting verses or telling stories, which they are supposed to
invent as they go on speaking. Some of these people speak with
great fluency, and collect crowds round them in the public
streets.&nbsp; When an Improvisatore sees the attention of his
audience fixed, and when he comes to some very interesting part
of his narrative, he dexterously drops his hat upon the ground,
and pauses till his auditors have paid tribute to his
eloquence.&nbsp; When he thinks the hat sufficiently full, he
takes it up again, and proceeds with his story.&nbsp; The hat was
dropped just as Francisco and his two friends came under the
piazza.&nbsp; The orator had finished one story, and was going to
commence another.&nbsp; He fixed his eyes upon Francisco, then
glanced at Carlo and Rosetta, and after a moment&rsquo;s
consideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one
that our young English readers may, perhaps, know by the name of
&ldquo;Cornaro, or the Grateful Turk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francisco was deeply interested in this narrative, and when
the hat was dropped, he eagerly threw in his contribution.&nbsp;
At the end of the story, when the speaker&rsquo;s voice stopped,
there was a momentary silence, which was broken by the orator
himself, who exclaimed, as he took up the hat which lay at his
feet, &ldquo;My friends, here is some mistake! this is not my
hat; it has been changed whilst I was taken up with my
story.&nbsp; Pray, gentlemen, find my hat amongst you; it was a
remarkably good one, a present from a nobleman for an epigram I
made.&nbsp; I would not lose my hat for twice its value.&nbsp; It
has my name written withinside of it, Dominicho,
Improvisatore.&nbsp; Pray, gentlemen, examine your
hats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody present examined their hats, and showed them to
Dominicho, but his was not amongst them.&nbsp; No one had left
the company; the piazza was cleared, and searched in vain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The hat has vanished by magic,&rdquo; said Dominicho.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and by the same magic a statue moves,&rdquo; cried
Carlo, pointing to a figure standing in a niche, which had
hitherto escaped observation.&nbsp; The face was so much in the
shade, that Carlo did not at first perceive that the statue was
Piedro.&nbsp; Piedro, when he saw himself discovered, burst into
a loud laugh, and throwing down Dominicho&rsquo;s hat, which he
held in his hand behind him, cried, &ldquo;A pretty set of
novices!&nbsp; Most excellent players at hide-and-seek you would
make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Piedro really meant to have carried off the poor
man&rsquo;s hat, or whether he was, as he said, merely in jest,
we leave it to those who know his general character to
decide.</p>
<p>Carlo shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still at your old tricks,
Piedro,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember the old proverb: No
fox so cunning but he comes to the furrier&rsquo;s at
last.&rdquo; <a name="citation332"></a><a href="#footnote332"
class="citation">[332]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I defy the furrier and you, too,&rdquo; replied Piedro,
taking up his own ragged hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no need to
steal hats; I can afford to buy better than you&rsquo;ll have
upon your head.&nbsp; Francisco, a word with you, if you have
done crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so
attentively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would you say to me?&rdquo; said Francisco,
following him a few steps.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not detain me long,
because my friends will wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they are friends, they can wait,&rdquo; said
Piedro.&nbsp; &ldquo;You need not be ashamed of being seen in my
company now, I can tell you; for I am, as I always told you I
should be, the richest man of the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich! you rich?&rdquo; cried Francisco.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, then, it was impossible you could mean to trick that
poor man out of his good hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said Piedro.&nbsp; Francisco did not
consider that those who have habits of pilfering continue to
practise them often, when the poverty which first tempted them to
dishonesty ceases.&nbsp; &ldquo;Impossible!&nbsp; You stare when
I tell you I am rich; but the thing is so.&nbsp; Moreover, I am
well with my father at home.&nbsp; I have friends in Naples, and
I call myself Piedro the Lucky.&nbsp; Look you here,&rdquo; said
he, producing an old gold coin.&nbsp; &ldquo;This does not smell
of fish, does it?&nbsp; My father is no longer a fisherman, nor I
either.&nbsp; Neither do I sell sugar-plums to children: nor do I
slave myself in a vineyard, like some folks; but fortune, when I
least expected it, has stood my friend.&nbsp; I have many pieces
of gold like this.&nbsp; Digging in my father&rsquo;s garden, it
was my luck to come to an old Roman vessel full of gold.&nbsp; I
have this day agreed for a house in Naples for my father.&nbsp;
We shall live, whilst we can afford it, like great folks, you
will see; and I shall enjoy the envy that will be felt by some of
my old friends, the little Neapolitan merchants, who will change
their note when they see my change of fortune.&nbsp; What say you
to all this, Francisco the Honest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I wish you joy of your prosperity, and hope you
may enjoy it long and well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no doubt of that.&nbsp; Everyone who has it
enjoys it <i>well</i>.&nbsp; He always dances well to whom
fortune pipes.&rdquo; <a name="citation333a"></a><a
href="#footnote333a" class="citation">[333a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no longer pipe, no longer dance,&rdquo; replied
Francisco; and here they parted; for Piedro walked away abruptly,
much mortified to perceive that his prosperity did not excite
much envy, or command any additional respect from Francisco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather,&rdquo; said Francisco, when he returned
to Carlo and Rosetta, who waited for him under the portico, where
he left them&mdash;&ldquo;I would rather have such good friends
as you, Carlo and Arthur, and some more I could name, and,
besides that, have a clear conscience, and work honestly for my
bread, than be as lucky as Piedro.&nbsp; Do you know he has found
a treasure, he says, in his father&rsquo;s garden&mdash;a vase
full of gold?&nbsp; He showed me one of the gold
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much good may they do him.&nbsp; I hope he came
honestly by them,&rdquo; said Carlo; &ldquo;but ever since the
affair of the double measure, I suspect double-dealing always
from him.&nbsp; It is not our affair, however.&nbsp; Let him make
himself happy his way, and we ours.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He that would live in peace and rest,<br
/>
Must hear, and see, and say the best.&rdquo; <a
name="citation333b"></a><a href="#footnote333b"
class="citation">[333b]</a></p>
<p>All Piedro&rsquo;s neighbours did not follow this peaceable
maxim; for when he and his father began to circulate the story of
the treasure found in the garden, the village of Resina did not
give them implicit faith.&nbsp; People nodded and whispered, and
shrugged their shoulders; then crossed themselves, and declared
that they would not, for all the riches of Naples, change places
with either Piedro or his father.&nbsp; Regardless, or pretending
to be regardless, of these suspicions, Piedro and his father
persisted in their assertions.&nbsp; The fishing-nets were sold,
and everything in their cottage was disposed of; they left
Resina, went to live at Naples, and, after a few weeks, the
matter began to be almost forgotten in the village.</p>
<p>The old gardener, Francisco&rsquo;s father, was one of those
who endeavoured to <i>think the best</i>; and all that he said
upon the subject was, that he would not exchange Francisco the
Honest for Piedro the Lucky; that one can&rsquo;t judge of the
day till one sees the evening as well as the morning. <a
name="citation334"></a><a href="#footnote334"
class="citation">[334]</a></p>
<p>Not to leave our readers longer in suspense, we must inform
them that the peasants of Resina were right in their
suspicions.&nbsp; Piedro had never found any treasure in his
father&rsquo;s garden, but he came by his gold in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>After he was banished from the little wood-market for stealing
Rosetta&rsquo;s basketful of wood, after he had cheated the poor
woman, who let glasses out to hire, out of the value of the
glasses which he broke, and, in short, after he had entirely lost
his credit with all who knew him, he roamed about the streets of
Naples, reckless of what became of him.</p>
<p>He found the truth of the proverb, &ldquo;that credit lost is
like a Venice glass broken&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be mended
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; The few shillings which he had in his pocket
supplied him with food for a few days.&nbsp; At last he was glad
to be employed by one of the peasants who came to Naples to load
their asses with manure out of the streets.&nbsp; They often
follow very early in the morning, or during the night-time, the
trace of carriages that are gone, or that are returning from the
opera; and Piedro was one night at this work, when the horses of
a nobleman&rsquo;s carriage took fright at the sudden blaze of
some fireworks.&nbsp; The carriage was overturned near him; a
lady was taken out of it, and was hurried by her attendants into
a shop, where she stayed till her carriage was set to
rights.&nbsp; She was too much alarmed for the first ten minutes
after her accident to think of anything; but after some time, she
perceived that she had lost a valuable diamond cross, which she
had worn that night at the opera.&nbsp; She was uncertain where
she had dropped it; the shop, the carriage, the street, were
searched for it in vain.</p>
<p>Piedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage,
seized upon it, and carried it off.&nbsp; Ignorant as he was of
the full value of what he had stolen, he knew not how to satisfy
himself as to this point, without trusting someone with the
secret.</p>
<p>After some hesitation, he determined to apply to a Jew, who,
as it was whispered, was ready to buy everything that was offered
to him for sale, without making any <i>troublesome</i>
inquiries.&nbsp; It was late; he waited till the streets were
cleared, and then knocked softly at the back door of the
Jew&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The person who opened the door for
Piedro was his own father.&nbsp; Piedro started back; but his
father had fast hold of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; said the father, in a low
voice, a voice which expressed fear and rage mixed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to ask my way&mdash;my shortest way,&rdquo;
stammered Piedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No equivocations!&nbsp; Tell me what brings you here at
this time of the night?&nbsp; I <i>will</i> know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piedro, who felt himself in his father&rsquo;s grasp, and who
knew that his father would certainly search him, to find out what
he had brought to sell, thought it most prudent to produce the
diamond cross.&nbsp; His father could but just see its lustre by
the light of a dim lamp, which hung over their heads in the
gloomy passage in which they stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have been duped, if you had gone to sell this
to the Jew.&nbsp; It is well it has fallen into my hands.&nbsp;
How came you by it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Piedro answered that he had
found it in the street.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go your ways home,
then,&rdquo; said his father; &ldquo;it is safe with me.&nbsp;
Concern yourself no more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piedro was not inclined thus to relinquish his booty, and he
now thought proper to vary in his account of the manner in which
he found the cross.&nbsp; He now confessed that it had dropped
from the dress of a lady, whose carriage was overturned as she
was coming home from the opera, and he concluded by saying that,
if his father took his prize from him without giving him his
share of the profits, he would go directly to the shop where the
lady stopped whilst her servants were raising the carriage, and
that he would give notice of his having found the cross.</p>
<p>Piedro&rsquo;s father saw that his <i>smart</i> son, though
scarcely sixteen years of age, was a match for him in
villainy.&nbsp; He promised him that he should have half of
whatever the Jew would give for the diamonds, and Piedro insisted
upon being present at the transaction.</p>
<p>We do not wish to lay open to our young readers scenes of
iniquity.&nbsp; It is sufficient to say that the Jew, who was a
man old in all the arts of villainy, contrived to cheat both his
associates, and obtained the diamond cross for less than half its
value.&nbsp; The matter was managed so that the transaction
remained undiscovered.&nbsp; The lady who lost the cross, after
making fruitless inquiries, gave up the search, and Piedro and
his father rejoiced in the success of their man&oelig;uvres.</p>
<p>It is said, that &ldquo;Ill gotten wealth is quickly
spent&rdquo;;&nbsp; <a name="citation336"></a><a
href="#footnote336" class="citation">[336]</a> and so it proved
in this instance.&nbsp; Both father and son lived a riotous life
as long as their money lasted, and it did not last many
months.&nbsp; What his bad education began, bad company finished,
and Piedro&rsquo;s mind was completely ruined by the associates
with whom he became connected during what he called his
<i>prosperity</i>.&nbsp; When his money was at an end, these
unprincipled friends began to look cold upon him, and at last
plainly told him&mdash;&ldquo;If you mean to <i>live with us</i>,
you must <i>live as we do</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They lived by
robbery.</p>
<p>Piedro, though familiarized to the idea of fraud, was shocked
at the thought of becoming a robber by profession.&nbsp; How
difficult it is to stop in the career of vice!&nbsp; Whether
Piedro had power to stop, or whether he was hurried on by his
associates, we shall, for the present, leave in doubt.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> turn with pleasure from Piedro
the Cunning to Francisco the Honest.&nbsp; Francisco continued
the happy and useful course of his life.&nbsp; By his unremitting
perseverance, he improved himself rapidly under the instructions
of his master and friend, Signor Camillo; his friend, we say, for
the fair and open character of Francisco won, or rather earned,
the friendship of this benevolent artist.&nbsp; The English
gentleman seemed to take a pride in our hero&rsquo;s success and
good conduct.&nbsp; He was not one of those patrons who think
that they have done enough when they have given five
guineas.&nbsp; His servant Arthur always considered every
generous action of his master&rsquo;s as his own, and was
particularly pleased whenever this generosity was directed
towards Francisco.</p>
<p>As for Carlo and the little Rosetta, they were the companions
of all the pleasant walks which Francisco used to take in the
cool of the evening, after he had been shut up all day at his
work.&nbsp; And the old carpenter, delighted with the gratitude
of his pupil, frequently repeated&mdash;&ldquo;that he was proud
to have given the first instructions to such a <i>genius</i>; and
that he had always prophesied Francisco would be a <i>great</i>
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a good man, papa,&rdquo; said Rosetta; &ldquo;for
though he has grown so great, and though he goes into palaces
now, to say nothing of that place underground, where he has leave
to go, yet, notwithstanding all this, he never forgets my brother
Carlo and you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to have good friends,&rdquo; said
the carpenter.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I like his way; he does more than
he says.&nbsp; Facts are masculine, and words are
feminine.&rdquo; <a name="citation337"></a><a href="#footnote337"
class="citation">[337]</a></p>
<p>These goods friends seemed to make Francisco happier than
Piedro could be made by his stolen diamonds.</p>
<p>One morning, Francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the
front of an ancient temple, amongst the ruins of
Herculaneum.&nbsp; He had just reached the pit, and the men were
about to let him down with cords, in the usual manner, when his
attention was caught by the shrill sound of a scolding
woman&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; He looked, and saw at some paces
distant this female fury, who stood guarding the windlass of a
well, to which, with threatening gestures and most voluble
menaces, she forbade all access.&nbsp; The peasants&mdash;men,
women and children, who had come with their pitchers to draw
water at this well&mdash;were held at bay by the enraged
female.&nbsp; Not one dared to be the first to advance; whilst
she grasped with one hand the handle of the windlass, and, with
the other tanned muscular arm extended, governed the populace,
bidding them remember that she was padrona, or mistress of the
well.&nbsp; They retired, in hopes of finding a more gentle
padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood; and the fury,
when they were out of sight, divided the long black hair which
hung over her face, and, turning to one of the spectators,
appealed to them in a sober voice, and asked if she was not right
in what she had done?&nbsp; &ldquo;I, that am padrona of the
well,&rdquo; said she, addressing herself to Francisco, who, with
great attention, was contemplating her with the eye of a
painter&mdash;&ldquo;I, that am padrona of the well, must in
times of scarcity do strict justice, and preserve for ourselves
alone the water of our well.&nbsp; There is scarcely enough even
for ourselves.&nbsp; I have been obliged to make my husband
lengthen the ropes every day for this week past.&nbsp; If things
go on at this rate, there will soon be not one drop of water left
in my well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood,&rdquo;
added one of the workmen, who was standing by; and he mentioned
several in which the water had lately suddenly decreased; and a
miller affirmed that his mill had stopped for want of water.</p>
<p>Francisco was struck by these remarks.&nbsp; They brought to
his recollection similar facts, which he had often heard his
father mention in his childhood, as having been observed previous
to the last eruption of Mount Vesuvius. <a
name="citation338a"></a><a href="#footnote338a"
class="citation">[338a]</a>&nbsp; He had also heard from his
father, in his childhood, that it is better to trust to prudence
than to fortune; and therefore, though the peasants and workmen,
to whom he mentioned his fears, laughed, and said, &ldquo;That as
the burning mountain had been favourable to them for so many
years, they would trust to it and St. Januarius one day
longer,&rdquo; yet Francisco immediately gave up all thoughts of
spending this day amidst the ruins of Herculaneum.&nbsp; After
having inquired sufficiently, after having seen several wells, in
which the water had evidently decreased, and after having seen
the mill-wheels that were standing still for want of their usual
supply, he hastened home to his father and mother, reported what
he had heard and seen, and begged of them to remove, and to take
what things of value they could to some distance from the
dangerous spot where they now resided.</p>
<p>Some of the inhabitants of Resina, whom he questioned,
declared that they had heard strange rumbling noises underground;
and a peasant and his son, who had been at work the preceding day
in a vineyard, a little above the village, related that they had
seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of the earth, close to them;
and that they had, at the same time, heard a noise like the going
off of a pistol. <a name="citation338b"></a><a
href="#footnote338b" class="citation">[338b]</a></p>
<p>The villagers listened with large eyes and open ears to these
relations; yet such was their habitual attachment to the spot
they lived upon, or such the security in their own good fortune,
that few of them would believe that there could be any necessity
for removing.&mdash;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what will happen
to-morrow; we shall be safe here one day longer,&rdquo; said
they.</p>
<p>Francisco&rsquo;s father and mother, more prudent than the
generality of their neighbours, went to the house of a relation,
at some miles&rsquo; distance from Vesuvius, and carried with
them all their effects.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Francisco went to the villa where his English
friends resided.&nbsp; The villa was in a most dangerous
situation, near Terre del Greco&mdash;a town that stands at the
foot of Mount Vesuvius.&nbsp; He related all the facts that he
had heard to Arthur, who, not having been, like the inhabitants
of Resina, familiarized to the idea of living in the vicinity of
a burning mountain, and habituated to trust in St. Januarius, was
sufficiently alarmed by Francisco&rsquo;s representations.&nbsp;
He ran to his master&rsquo;s apartment, and communicated all that
he had just heard.&nbsp; The Count de Flora and his lady, who
were at this time in the house, ridiculed the fears of Arthur,
and could not be prevailed upon to remove even as far as
Naples.&nbsp; The lady was intent upon preparations for her
birthday, which was to be celebrated in a few days with great
magnificence at their villa; and she observed that it would be a
pity to return to town before that day, and they had everything
arranged for the festival.&nbsp; The prudent Englishman had not
the gallantry to appear to be convinced by these arguments, and
he left the place of danger.&nbsp; He left it not too soon, for
the next morning exhibited a scene&mdash;a scene which we shall
not attempt to describe.</p>
<p>We refer our young readers to the account of this dreadful
eruption of Mount Vesuvius, published by Sir W. Hamilton in the
&ldquo;Philosophical Transactions.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is sufficient
here to say that, in the space of about five hours, the wretched
inhabitants of Torre del Greco saw their town utterly destroyed
by the streams of burning lava which poured from the
mountain.&nbsp; The villa of Count de Flora, with some others,
which were at a little distance from the town, escaped; but they
were absolutely surrounded by the lava.&nbsp; The count and
countess were obliged to fly from their house with the utmost
precipitation in the night-time; and they had not time to remove
any of their furniture, their plate, clothes, or jewels.</p>
<p>A few days after the eruption, the surface of the lava became
so cool that people could walk upon it, though several feet
beneath the surface it was still exceedingly hot.&nbsp; Numbers
of those who had been forced from their houses now returned to
the ruins to try to save whatever they could.&nbsp; But these
unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had been
pillaged by robbers, who, in these moments of general confusion,
enrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the count abandoned his villa? and is there no one
to take care of his plate and furniture?&nbsp; The house will
certainly be ransacked before morning,&rdquo; said the old
carpenter to Francisco, who was at his house giving him an
account of their flight.&nbsp; Francisco immediately went to the
count&rsquo;s house in warn him of his danger.&nbsp; The first
person he saw was Arthur, who, with a face of terror, said to
him, &ldquo;Do you know what has happened?&nbsp; It is all over
with Resina!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All over with Resina!&nbsp; What, has there been a
fresh eruption?&nbsp; Has the lava reached Resina?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but it will inevitably be blown up.&nbsp;
There,&rdquo; said Arthur, pointing to a thin figure of an
Italian, who stood pale and trembling, and looking up to heaven
as he crossed himself repeatedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said
Arthur, &ldquo;is a man who has left a parcel of his cursed
rockets and fireworks, with I don&rsquo;t know how much
gunpowder, in the count&rsquo;s house, from which we have just
fled.&nbsp; The wind blows that way.&nbsp; One spark of fire, and
the whole is blown up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francisco waited not to hear more; but instantly, without
explaining his intentions to anyone, set out for the
count&rsquo;s villa, and, with a bucket of water in his hand,
crossed the beds of lava with which the house was encompassed;
when, reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were
left, he plunged them into the water, and returned with them in
safety over the lava, yet warm under his feet.</p>
<p>What was the surprise and joy of the poor firework-maker when
he saw Francisco return from this dangerous expedition!&nbsp; He
could scarcely believe his eyes, when he saw the rockets and the
gunpowder all safe.</p>
<p>The count, who had given up the hopes of saving his palace,
was in admiration when he heard of this instance of intrepidity,
which properly saved not only his villa, but the whole village of
Resina, from destruction.&nbsp; These fireworks had been prepared
for the celebration of the countess&rsquo; birthday, and were
forgotten in the hurry of the night on which the inhabitants fled
from Torre del Greco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave young man!&rdquo; said the count to Francisco,
&ldquo;I thank you, and shall not limit my gratitude to
thanks.&nbsp; You tell me that there is danger of my villa being
pillaged by robbers.&nbsp; It is from this moment your interest,
as well as mine, to prevent their depredations; for (trust to my
liberality) a portion of all that is saved of mine shall be
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! bravissimo!&rdquo; exclaimed one, who started
from a recessed window in the hall where all this passed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bravo! bravissimo!&rdquo;&mdash;Francisco thought he knew
the voice and the countenance of this man, who exclaimed with so
much enthusiasm.&nbsp; He remembered to have seen him before, but
when, or where, he could not recollect.&nbsp; As soon as the
count left the hall, the stranger came up to Francisco.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you
don&rsquo;t know me?&nbsp; It is scarcely a twelvemonth since I
drew tears from your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tears from my eyes?&rdquo; repeated Francisco, smiling;
&ldquo;I have shed but few tears.&nbsp; I have had but few
misfortunes in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stranger answered him by
two extempore Italian lines, which conveyed nearly the same idea
that has been so well expressed by an English poet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To each their sufferings&mdash;all are
men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Condemn&rsquo;d alike to groan;<br />
The feeling for another&rsquo;s woes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo; unfeeling for his own.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I know you now perfectly well,&rdquo; cried Francisco;
&ldquo;you are the Improvisatore who, one fine moonlight night
last summer, told us the story of Cornaro the Turk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said the Improvisatore; &ldquo;the
same, though in a better dress, which I should not have thought
would have made so much difference in your eyes, though it makes
all the difference between man and man in the eyes of the stupid
vulgar.&nbsp; My genius has broken through the clouds of
misfortune of late.&nbsp; A few happy impromptu verses I made on
the Count de Flora&rsquo;s fall from his horse attracted
attention.&nbsp; The count patronizes me.&nbsp; I am here now to
learn the fate of an ode I have just composed for his
lady&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp; My ode was to have been set to
music, and to have been performed at his villa near Torre del
Greco, if these troubles had not intervened.&nbsp; Now that the
mountain is quiet again, people will return to their
senses.&nbsp; I expect to be munificently rewarded.&nbsp; But,
perhaps, I detain you.&nbsp; Go; I shall not forget to celebrate
the heroic action you have performed this day.&nbsp; I still
amuse myself amongst the populace in my tattered garb late in the
evenings, and I shall sound your praises through Naples in a poem
I mean to recite on the late eruption of Mount Vesuvius.&nbsp;
Adieu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Improvisatore was as good as his word.&nbsp; That evening,
with more than his usual enthusiasm, he recited his verses to a
great crowd of people in one of the public squares.&nbsp; Amongst
the crowd were several to whom the name of Francisco was well
known, and by whom he was well beloved.&nbsp; These were his
young companions, who remembered him as a fruit-seller amongst
the little merchants.&nbsp; They rejoiced to hear his praises,
and repeated the lines with shouts of applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us pass.&nbsp; What is all this disturbance in the
streets?&rdquo; said a man, pushing his way through the
crowd.&nbsp; A lad who held by his arm stopped suddenly on
hearing the name of Francisco, which the people were repeating
with so much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; I have found at last a story that interests
you more than that of Cornaro the Turk,&rdquo; cried the
Improvisatore, looking in the face of the youth, who had stopped
so suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are the young man who, last summer,
had liked to have tricked me out of my new hat.&nbsp; Promise me
you won&rsquo;t touch it now,&rdquo; said he, throwing down the
hat at his feet, &ldquo;or you hear not one word I have to
say.&nbsp; Not one word of the heroic action performed at the
villa of the Count de Flora, near Torre del Greco, this morning,
by Signor Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Signor</i> Francisco!&rdquo; repeated the lad with
disdain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, let us hear what you have to tell of
him,&rdquo; added he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your hat is very safe, I
promise you; I shall not touch it.&nbsp; What of <i>Signor</i>
Francisco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Signor</i> Francisco I may, without impropriety,
call him,&rdquo; said the Improvisatore, &ldquo;for he is likely
to become rich enough to command the title from those who might
not otherwise respect his merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely to become rich! how?&rdquo; said the lad, whom
our readers have probably before this time discovered to be
Piedro.&nbsp; &ldquo;How, pray, is he likely to become rich
enough to be a signor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Count de Flora has promised him a liberal portion
of all the fine furniture, plate and jewels that can be saved
from his villa at Torre del Greco.&nbsp; Francisco is gone down
hither now with some of the count&rsquo;s domestics to protect
the valuable goods against those villainous plunderers, who
robbed their fellow-creatures of what even the flames of Vesuvius
would spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we have had enough of this stuff,&rdquo; cried
the man whose arm Piedro held.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; and
he hurried forwards.</p>
<p>This man was one of the villains against whom the honest
orator expressed such indignation.&nbsp; He was one of those with
whom Piedro got acquainted during the time that he was living
extravagantly upon the money he gained by the sale of the stolen
diamond cross.&nbsp; That robbery was not discovered; and his
success, as he called it, hardened him in guilt.&nbsp; He was
both unwilling and unable to withdraw himself from the bad
company with whom his ill gotten wealth connected him.&nbsp; He
did not consider that bad company leads to the gallows. <a
name="citation342"></a><a href="#footnote342"
class="citation">[342]</a></p>
<p>The universal confusion which followed the eruption of Mount
Vesuvius was to these villains a time of rejoicing.&nbsp; No
sooner did Piedro&rsquo;s companion hear of the rich furniture,
plate, etc., which the imprudent orator had described as
belonging to the Count de Flora&rsquo;s villa, than he longed to
make himself master of the whole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; said Piedro, &ldquo;that the count
has sent Francisco, with his servants down to guard
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is this Francisco of whom you seem to stand in
so much awe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy, a young lad only, of about my own age; but I
know him to be sturdily honest.&nbsp; The servants we might
corrupt; but even the old proverb of &lsquo;Angle with a silver
hook,&rsquo; <a name="citation343"></a><a href="#footnote343"
class="citation">[343]</a> won&rsquo;t hold good with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he cannot be won by fair means, he must be
conquered by foul,&rdquo; said the desperate villain; &ldquo;but
if we offer him rather more than the count has already promised
for his share of the booty, of course he will consult at once his
safety and his interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Piedro; &ldquo;that is not his
nature.&nbsp; I know him from a child, and we had better think of
some other house for to-night&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other; none but this,&rdquo; cried his companion,
with an oath.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mind is determined upon this, and
you must obey your leader: recollect the fate of him who failed
me yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person to whom he alluded was one of the gang of robbers
who had been assassinated by his companions for hesitating to
commit some crime suggested by their leader.&nbsp; No tyranny is
so dreadful as that which is exercised by villains over their
young accomplices, who become their slaves.&nbsp; Piedro, who was
of a cowardly nature, trembled at the threatening countenance of
his captain, and promised submission.</p>
<p>In the course of the morning, inquiries were made secretly
amongst the count&rsquo;s servants; and the two men who were
engaged to sit up at the villa that night along with Francisco,
were bribed to second the views of this gang of thieves.&nbsp; It
was agreed that about midnight the robbers should be let into the
house; that Francisco should be tied hand and foot, whilst they
carried off their booty.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a stubborn chap,
though so young, I understand,&rdquo; said the captain of the
robbers to his men; &ldquo;but we carry poniards, and know how to
use them.&nbsp; Piedro, you look pale.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
require to be reminded of what I said to you when we were alone
just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piedro&rsquo;s voice failed, and some of his comrades observed
that he was young and new to the business.&nbsp; The captain,
who, from being his pretended friend during his wealthy days, had
of late become his tyrant, cast a stern look at Piedro, and bid
him be sure to be at the old Jew&rsquo;s, which was the place of
meeting, in the dusk of the evening.&nbsp; After saying this he
departed.</p>
<p>Piedro, when he was alone, tried to collect his
thoughts&mdash;all his thoughts were full of horror.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; said he to himself; &ldquo;what am I
about?&nbsp; Did I understand rightly what he said about
poniards?&nbsp; Francisco; oh, Francisco!&nbsp; Excellent, kind,
generous Francisco!&nbsp; Yes, I recollect your look when you
held the bunch of grapes to my lips, as I sat by the sea-shore
deserted by all the world; and now, what friends have I.&nbsp;
Robbers and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; The word <i>murderers</i> he
could not utter.&nbsp; He again recollected what had been said
about poniards, and the longer his mind fixed upon the words, and
the look that accompanied them, the more he was shocked.&nbsp; He
could not doubt but that it was the serious intention of his
accomplices to murder Francisco, if he should make any
resistance.</p>
<p>Piedro had at this moment no friend in the world to whom he
could apply for advice or assistance.&nbsp; His wretched father
died some weeks before this time, in a fit of intoxication.&nbsp;
Piedro walked up and down the street, scarcely capable of
thinking, much less of coming to any rational resolution.</p>
<p>The hours passed away, the shadows of the houses lengthened
under his footsteps, the evening came on, and when it grew dusk,
after hesitating in great agony of mind for some time, his fear
of the robbers&rsquo; vengeance prevailed over every other
feeling, and he went at the appointed hour to the place of
meeting.</p>
<p>The place of meeting was at the house of that Jew to whom he,
several months before, sold the diamond cross.&nbsp; That cross
which he thought himself so lucky to have stolen, and to have
disposed of undetected, was, in fact, the cause of his being in
his present dreadful situation.&nbsp; It was at the Jew&rsquo;s
that he connected himself with this gang of robbers, to whom he
was now become an absolute slave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that I dared to disobey!&rdquo; said he to himself,
with a deep sigh, as he knocked softly at the back door of the
Jew&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The back door opened into a narrow,
unfrequented street, and some small rooms at this side of the
house were set apart for the reception of guests who desired to
have their business kept secret.&nbsp; These rooms were separated
by a dark passage from the rest of the house, and numbers of
people came to the shop in the front of the house, which looked
into a creditable street, without knowing anything more, from the
ostensible appearance of the shop, than that it was a kind of
pawnbroker&rsquo;s, where old clothes, old iron, and all sorts of
refuse goods, might be disposed of conveniently.</p>
<p>At the moment Piedro knocked at the back door, the front shop
was full of customers; and the Jew&rsquo;s boy, whose office it
was to attend to these signals, let Piedro in, told him that none
of his comrades were yet come, and left him in a room by
himself.</p>
<p>He was pale and trembling, and felt a cold dew spread over
him.&nbsp; He had a leaden image of Saint Januarius tied round
his neck, which, in the midst of his wickedness, he
superstitiously preserved as a sort of charm, and on this he kept
his eyes stupidly fixed, as he sat alone in this gloomy
place.</p>
<p>He listened from time to time, but he heard no noise at the
side of the house where he was.&nbsp; His accomplices did not
arrive, and, in a sort of impatient terror, the attendant upon an
evil conscience, he flung open the door of his cell, and groped
his way through the passage which he knew led to the public
shop.&nbsp; He longed to hear some noise, and to mix with the
living.&nbsp; The Jew, when Piedro entered the shop, was
bargaining with a poor, thin-looking man about some
gunpowder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that it has been wet,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;but since it was in the bucket of water, it has
been carefully dried.&nbsp; I tell you the simple truth, that so
soon after the grand eruption of Mount Vesuvius, the people of
Naples will not relish fireworks.&nbsp; My poor little rockets,
and even my Catherine-wheels, will have no effect.&nbsp; I am
glad to part with all I have in this line of business.&nbsp; A
few days ago I had fine things in readiness for the Countess de
Flora&rsquo;s birthday, which was to have been celebrated at the
count&rsquo;s villa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you fix your eyes on me, friend?&nbsp; What is
your discourse to me?&rdquo; said Piedro, who imagined that the
man fixed his eyes upon him as he mentioned the name of the
count&rsquo;s villa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know that I fixed my eyes upon you; I was
thinking of my fireworks,&rdquo; said the poor man, simply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But now that I do look at you and hear your voice, I
recollect having had the pleasure of seeing you
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When? where?&rdquo; said Piedro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great while ago; no wonder you have forgotten
me,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;but I can recall the night to
your recollection.&nbsp; You were in the street with me the night
I let off that unlucky rocket, which frightened the horses, and
was the cause of overturning a lady&rsquo;s coach.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you remember the circumstance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a confused recollection of some such
thing,&rdquo; said Piedro, in great embarrassment; and he looked
suspiciously at this man, in doubt whether he was cunning, and
wanted to sound him, or whether he was so simple as he
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not, perhaps, hear, then,&rdquo; continued the
man, &ldquo;that there was a great search made, after the
overturn, for a fine diamond cross, belonging to the lady in the
carriage?&nbsp; That lady, though I did not know it till lately,
was the Countess de Flora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of the matter,&rdquo; interrupted
Piedro, in great agitation.&nbsp; His confusion was so marked,
that the firework-maker could not avoid taking notice of it; and
a silence of some moments ensued.&nbsp; The Jew, more practised
in dissimulation than Piedro, endeavoured to turn the man&rsquo;s
attention back to his rockets and his gunpowder&mdash;agreed to
take the gunpowder&mdash;paid for it in haste, and was, though
apparently unconcerned, eager to get rid of him.&nbsp; But this
was not so easily done.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s curiosity was
excited, and his suspicions of Piedro were increased every moment
by all the dark changes of his countenance.&nbsp; Piedro,
overpowered with the sense of guilt, surprised at the unexpected
mention of the diamond cross, and of the Count de Flora&rsquo;s
villa, stood like one convicted, and seemed fixed to the spot,
without power of motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to look at the old cambric that you said you
had&mdash;that would do for making&mdash;that you could let me
have cheap for artificial flowers,&rdquo; said the firework-maker
to the Jew; and as he spoke, his eye from time to time looked
towards Piedro.</p>
<p>Piedro felt for the leaden image of the saint, which he wore
round his neck.&nbsp; The string which held it cracked, and broke
with the pull he gave it.&nbsp; This slight circumstance affected
his terrified and superstitious mind more than all the
rest.&nbsp; He imagined that at this moment his fate was decided;
that Saint Januarius deserted him, and that he was undone.&nbsp;
He precipitately followed the firework-man the instant he left
the shop, and seizing hold of his arm, whispered, &ldquo;I must
speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, then,&rdquo; said the man, astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here; this way,&rdquo; said he, drawing him towards
the dark passage: &ldquo;what I have to say must not be
overheard.&nbsp; You are going to the Count de Flora&rsquo;s, are
not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp; He was going there to
speak to the countess about some artificial flowers; but Piedro
thought he was going to speak to her about the diamond cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to give information against me?&nbsp;
Nay, hear me, I confess that I purloined that diamond cross; but
I can do the count a great service, upon condition that he
pardons me.&nbsp; His villa is to be attacked this night by four
well armed men.&nbsp; They will set out five hours hence.&nbsp; I
am compelled, under the threat of assassination, to accompany
them; but I shall do no more.&nbsp; I throw myself upon the
count&rsquo;s mercy.&nbsp; Hasten to him&mdash;we have no time to
lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor man, who heard this confession, escaped from Piedro
the moment he loosed his arm.&nbsp; With all possible expedition
he ran to the count&rsquo;s palace in Naples, and related to him
all that had been said by Piedro.&nbsp; Some of the count&rsquo;s
servants, on whom he could most depend, were at a distant part of
the city attending their mistress, but the English gentleman
offered the services of his man Arthur.&nbsp; Arthur no sooner
heard the business, and understood that Francisco was in danger,
than he armed himself without saying one word, saddled his
English horse, and was ready to depart before anyone else had
finished their exclamations and conjectures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are not to set out yet,&rdquo; said the servant;
&ldquo;it is but four miles to Torre del Greco; the sbirri
(officers of justice) are summoned&mdash;they are to go with
us&mdash;we must wait for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited, much against Arthur&rsquo;s inclination, a
considerable time for these sbirri.&nbsp; At length they set out,
and just as they reached the villa, the flash of the pistol was
seen from one of the apartments in the house.&nbsp; The robbers
were there.&nbsp; This pistol was snapped by their captain at
poor Francisco, who had bravely asserted that he would, as long
as he had life, defend the property committed to his care.&nbsp;
The pistol missed fire, for it was charged with some of the
damaged powder which the Jew had bought that evening from the
firework maker, and which he had sold as excellent immediately
afterwards to his favourite customers&mdash;the robbers who met
at his house.</p>
<p>Arthur, as soon as he perceived the flash of the piece,
pressed forward through all the apartments, followed by the
count&rsquo;s servants and the officers of justice.&nbsp; At the
sudden appearance of so many armed men, the robbers stood
dismayed.&nbsp; Arthur eagerly shook Francisco&rsquo;s hand,
congratulating him upon his safety, and did not perceive, till he
had given him several rough friendly shakes, that his arm was
wounded, and that he was pale with the loss of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not much&mdash;only a slight wound,&rdquo; said
Francisco; &ldquo;one that I should have escaped, if I had been
upon my guard; but the sight of a face that I little expected to
see in such company took from me all presence of mind; and one of
the ruffians stabbed me here in the arm, whilst I stood in stupid
astonishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! take me to prison! take me to prison&mdash;I am
weary of life&mdash;I am a wretch not fit to live!&rdquo; cried
Piedro, holding his hands to be tied by the sbirri.</p>
<p>The next morning Piedro was conveyed to prison; and as he
passed through the streets of Naples he was met by several of
those who had known him when he was a child.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said they, as he went by, &ldquo;his father
encouraged him in cheating when he was <i>but a child</i>; and
see what he is come to, now he is a man!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
ordered to remain twelve months in solitary confinement.&nbsp;
His captain and his accomplices were sent to the galleys, and the
Jew was banished from Naples.</p>
<p>And now, having got these villains out of the way, let us
return to honest Francisco.&nbsp; His wound was soon
healed.&nbsp; Arthur was no bad surgeon, for he let his patient
get well as fast as he pleased; and Carlo and Rosetta nursed him
with so much kindness, that he was almost sorry to find himself
perfectly recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you are able to go out,&rdquo; said
Francisco&rsquo;s father to him, &ldquo;you must come and look at
my new house, my dear son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your new house, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, son, and a charming one it is, and a handsome
piece of land near it&mdash;all at a safe distance, too, from
Mount Vesuvius; and can you guess how I came by it?&mdash;it was
given to me for having a good son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Carlo; &ldquo;the inhabitants of
Resina, and several who had property near Terre del Greco, and
whose houses and lives were saved by your intrepidity in carrying
the materials for the fireworks and the gunpowder out of this
dangerous place, went in a body to the duke, and requested that
he would mention your name and these facts to the king, who,
amongst the grants he has made to the sufferers by the late
eruption of Mount Vesuvius, has been pleased to say that he gives
this house and garden to your father, because you have saved the
property and lives of many of his subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The value of a handsome portion of furniture, plate, etc., in
the Count de Flora&rsquo;s villa, was, according to the
count&rsquo;s promise, given to him; and this money he divided
between his own family and that of the good carpenter who first
put a pencil into his hands.&nbsp; Arthur would not accept of any
present from him.&nbsp; To Mr. Lee, the English gentleman, he
offered one of his own drawings&mdash;a fruit-piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like this very well,&rdquo; said Arthur, as he
examined the drawing, &ldquo;but I should like this melon better
if it was a little bruised.&nbsp; It is now three years ago since
I was going to buy that bruised melon from you; you showed me
your honest nature then, though you were but a boy; and I have
found you the same ever since.&nbsp; A good beginning makes a
good ending&mdash;an honest boy will make an honest man; and
honesty is the best policy, as you have proved to all who wanted
the proof, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Francisco&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;I
think it is pretty plain that Piedro the Cunning has not managed
quite so well as Francisco the Honest.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Young Hardy</span> was educated by Mr.
Freeman, a very excellent master, at one of our rural Sunday
schools.&nbsp; He was honest, obedient, active and good-natured,
hence he was esteemed by his master; and being beloved by all his
companions who were good, he did not desire to be loved by the
bad; nor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle, mischievous or
dishonest boys attempted to plague or ridicule him.&nbsp; His
friend Loveit, on the contrary, wished to be universally liked,
and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy
in the school&mdash;and so he was.&nbsp; He usually went by the
name of <i>Poor Loveit</i>, and everybody pitied him when he got
into disgrace, which he frequently did, for though he had a good
disposition, he was led to do things which he knew to be wrong
merely because he could never have the courage to say
&ldquo;<i>No</i>,&rdquo; because he was afraid to offend the
ill-natured, and could not bear to be laughed at by fools.</p>
<p>One fine autumn evening, all the boys were permitted to go out
to play in a pleasant green meadow near the school.&nbsp; Loveit
and another boy, called Tarlton, began to play a game of
battledore and shuttlecock, and a large party stood by to look
on, for they were the best players at battledore and shuttlecock
in the school, and this was a trial of skill between them.&nbsp;
When they had got it up to three hundred and twenty, the game
became very interesting.&nbsp; The arms of the combatants tired
that they could scarcely wield the battledores.&nbsp; The
shuttlecock began to waver in the air; now it almost touched the
ground, and now, to the astonishment of the spectators, mounted
again high over their heads: yet the strokes became feebler and
feebler; and &ldquo;Now, Loveit!&rdquo; &ldquo;Now,
Tarlton!&rdquo; resounded on all sides.&nbsp; For another minute
the victory was doubtful; but at length the setting sun, shining
full in Loveit&rsquo;s face, so dazzled his eyes that he could no
longer see the shuttlecock, and it fell at his feet.</p>
<p>After the first shout for Tarlton&rsquo;s triumph was over,
everybody exclaimed, &ldquo;Poor Loveit! he&rsquo;s the best
natured fellow in the world!&nbsp; What a pity that he did not
stand with his back to the sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I dare you all to play another game with
me,&rdquo; cried Tarlton, vauntingly; and as he spoke, he tossed
the shuttlecock up with all his force&mdash;with so much force
that it went over the hedge and dropped into a lane, which went
close beside the field.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hey-day!&rdquo; said
Tarlton, &ldquo;what shall we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were strictly forbidden to go into the lane; and it
was upon their promise not to break this command, that they were
allowed to play in the adjoining field.</p>
<p>No other shuttlecock was to be had and their play was
stopped.&nbsp; They stood on the top of the bank, peeping over
the hedge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see it yonder,&rdquo; said Tarlton;
&ldquo;I wish somebody would get it.&nbsp; One could get over the
gate at the bottom of the field, and be back again in half a
minute,&rdquo; added he, looking at Loveit.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you
know we must not go into the lane,&rdquo; said Loveit,
hesitatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pugh!&rdquo; said Tarlton, &ldquo;why,
now, what harm could it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Loveit, drumming upon
his battledore; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know, man! why, then, what are you
afraid of, I ask you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Loveit coloured, went on
drumming, and again, in a lower voice, said &ldquo;<i>he
didn&rsquo;t know</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But upon Tarlton&rsquo;s
repeating, in a more insolent tone, &ldquo;I ask you, man, what
you&rsquo;re afraid of?&rdquo; he suddenly left off drumming, and
looking round, said, &ldquo;he was not afraid of anything that he
knew of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you are,&rdquo; said Hardy, coming
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; said Loveit; &ldquo;of what, pray, am I
afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of doing wrong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid <i>of doing wrong</i>!&rdquo; repeated Tarlton,
mimicking him, so that he made everybody laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,
hadn&rsquo;t you better say afraid of being flogged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hardy, coolly, after the laugh had
somewhat subsided, &ldquo;I am as little afraid of being flogged
as you are, Tarlton; but I meant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what you meant; why should you interfere with
your wisdom and your meanings; nobody thought of asking
<i>you</i> to stir a step for us; but we asked Loveit, because
he&rsquo;s the best fellow in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for that very reason you should not ask him,
because, you know he can&rsquo;t refuse you anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, though,&rdquo; cried Loveit, piqued,
&ldquo;<i>there</i> you&rsquo;re mistaken, for I could refuse if
I chose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardy smiled; and Loveit, half afraid of his contempt, and
half afraid of Tarlton&rsquo;s ridicule, stood doubtful, and
again had recourse to his battledore, which he balanced most
curiously upon his forefinger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at
him!&mdash;now do look at him!&rdquo; cried Tarlton; &ldquo;did
you ever in your life see anybody look so silly?&mdash;Hardy has
him quite under his thumb; he&rsquo;s so mortally afraid of
Parson Prig, that he dare not, for the soul of him, turn either
of his eyes from the tip of his nose; look how he
squints!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t squint,&rdquo; said Loveit, looking up,
&ldquo;and nobody has me under his thumb! and what Hardy said was
only for fear I should get in disgrace; he&rsquo;s the best
friend I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loveit spoke this with more than usual spirit, for both his
heart and his pride were touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; said Hardy, taking him by the
arm in an affectionate manner; and he was just going, when
Tarlton called after him, &ldquo;Ay, go along with its best
friend, and take care it does not get into a
scrape;&mdash;good-bye, Little Panado!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do they call Little Panado?&rdquo; said Loveit,
turning his head hastily back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Hardy, &ldquo;what does it
signify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Loveit, &ldquo;to be sure it does not
signify; but one does not like to be called Little Panado:
besides,&rdquo; added he, after going a few steps farther,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll all think it so ill-natured.&nbsp; I had
better go back, and just tell them that I&rsquo;m very sorry I
can&rsquo;t get their shuttlecock; do come back with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hardy, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go back;
and you&rsquo;d better not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I assure you, I won&rsquo;t stay a minute; wait
for me,&rdquo; added Loveit; and he slunk back again to prove
that he was not Little Panado.</p>
<p>Once returned, the rest followed, of course; for to support
his character of good-nature he was obliged to yield to the
entreaties of his companions, and to show his spirit, leapt over
the gate, amidst the acclamations of the little mob:&mdash;he was
quickly out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; cried he, returning in about five minutes,
quite out of breath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the shuttlecock; and
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo; cried he,
panting for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried everybody, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just at the turn of the corner, at the end of the
lane&rdquo;&mdash;panting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tarlton, impatiently, &ldquo;do go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me just take breath first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pugh&mdash;never mind your breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, just at the turn of the corner, at the end
of the lane, as I was looking about for the shuttlecock, I heard
a great rustling somewhere near me, and so I looked where it
could come from; and I saw, in a nice little garden, on the
opposite side of the way, a boy, about as big as Tarlton, sitting
in a great tree, shaking the branches: so I called to the boy, to
beg one; but he said he could not give me one, for that they were
his grandfather&rsquo;s; and just at that minute, from behind a
gooseberry bush, up popped the uncle; the grandfather poked his
head out of the window; so I ran off as fast as my legs would
carry me though I heard him bawling after me all the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let him bawl,&rdquo; cried Tarlton; &ldquo;he
shan&rsquo;t bawl for nothing; I&rsquo;m determined we&rsquo;ll
have some of his fine large rosy apples before I sleep
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this speech a general silence ensued; everybody kept their
eyes fixed upon Tarlton, except Loveit, who looked down,
apprehensive that he should be drawn on much farther than he
intended.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said he to himself,
&ldquo;as Hardy told me, I had better not have come
back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regardless of this confusion, Tarlton continued, &ldquo;But
before I say any more, I hope we have no spies amongst us.&nbsp;
If there is any one of you afraid to be flogged, let him march
off this instant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loveit coloured, bit his lips, wished to go, but had not the
courage to move first.&nbsp; He waited to see what everybody else
would do: nobody stirred; so Loveit stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; cried Tarlton, giving his hand to
the boy next him, then to the next, &ldquo;your word and honour
that you won&rsquo;t betray me; but stand by me, and I&rsquo;ll
stand by you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each boy gave his hand and his
promise; repeating, &ldquo;Stand by me, and I&rsquo;ll stand by
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loveit hung back till the last; and had almost twisted off the
button of the boy&rsquo;s coat who screened him, when Tarlton
came up, holding out his hand, &ldquo;Come, Loveit, lad,
you&rsquo;re in for it: stand by me, and I&rsquo;ll stand by
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Tarlton,&rdquo; expostulated he, without
looking him in the face, &ldquo;I do wish you&rsquo;d give up
this scheme; I daresay all the apples are gone by this time; I
wish you would.&nbsp; Do, pray, give up this scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What scheme, man? you have&rsquo;n&rsquo;t heard it
yet; you may as well know your text before you begin
preaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corners of Loveit&rsquo;s mouth could not refuse to smile,
though in his heart he felt not the slightest inclination to
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know you, I declare I don&rsquo;t
know you to-day,&rdquo; said Tarlton; &ldquo;you used to be the
best natured most agreeable lad in the world, and would do
anything one asked you; but you&rsquo;re quite altered of late,
as we were saying just now, when you skulked away with Hardy:
come,&mdash;do, man, pluck up a little spirit, and be one of us,
or you&rsquo;ll make us all <i>hate you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hate</i> me!&rdquo; repeated Loveit, with terror;
&ldquo;no, surely, you won&rsquo;t all <i>hate</i> me!&rdquo; and
he mechanically stretched out his hand which Tarlton shook
violently, saying, &ldquo;Ay, now, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, now, that&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; whispered
Loveit&rsquo;s conscience; but his conscience was of no use to
him, for it was always overpowered by the voice of numbers; and
though he had the wish, he never had the power, to do
right.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor Loveit!&nbsp; I knew he would not refuse
us,&rdquo; cried his companions; and even Tarlton, the moment he
shook hands with him, despised him.&nbsp; It is certain that
weakness of mind is despised both by the good and the bad.</p>
<p>The league being thus formed, Tarlton assumed all the airs of
commander, explained his schemes, and laid the plan of attack
upon the poor old man&rsquo;s apple-tree.&nbsp; It was the only
one he had the world.&nbsp; We shall not dwell upon their
consultation; for the amusement of contriving such expeditions is
often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in
them.</p>
<p>There was a small window at the end of the back staircase,
through which, between nine and ten o&rsquo;clock at night,
Tarlton, accompanied by Loveit and another boy, crept out.&nbsp;
It was a moonlight night, and after crossing the field, and
climbing the gate, directed by Loveit, who now resolved to go
through the affair with spirit, they proceeded down the lane with
rash yet fearful steps.</p>
<p>At a distance Loveit saw the white washed cottage, and the
apple-tree beside it.&nbsp; They quickened their pace, and with
some difficulty scrambled through the hedge which fenced the
garden, though not without being scratched and torn by the
briers.&nbsp; Everything was silent.&nbsp; Yet now and then, at
every rustling of the leaves, they started, and their hearts beat
violently.&nbsp; Once, as Loveit was climbing the apple-tree, he
thought he heard a door in the cottage open, and earnestly begged
his companions to desist and return home.&nbsp; This, however, he
could by no means persuade them to do, until they had filled
their pockets with apples; then, to his great joy, they returned,
crept in at the window and each retired, as softly as possible,
to his own apartment.</p>
<p>Loveit slept in the room with Hardy, whom he had left fast
asleep, and whom he now was extremely afraid of awakening.&nbsp;
All the apples were emptied out of Loveit&rsquo;s pockets, and
lodged with Tarlton till the morning, for fear the smell should
betray the secret to Hardy.&nbsp; The room door was apt to creak,
but it was opened with such precaution, that no noise could be
heard, and Loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;how quietly he
sleeps!&nbsp; I wish I had been sleeping too.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
reproaches of Loveit&rsquo;s conscience, however, served no other
purpose but to torment him; he had not sufficient strength of
mind to be good.&nbsp; The very next night, in spite of all his
fears, and all his penitence, and all his resolutions, by a
little fresh ridicule and persuasion he was induced to accompany
the same party on a similar expedition.&nbsp; We must observe,
that the necessity for continuing their depredations became
stronger the third day; for, though at first only a small party
had been in the secret, by degrees it was divulged to the whole
school; and it was necessary to secure secrecy by sharing the
booty.</p>
<p>Everyone was astonished that Hardy, with all his quickness and
penetration, had not yet discovered their proceedings; but Loveit
could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he
appeared to be.&nbsp; Loveit had strictly kept his promise of
secrecy; but he was by no means an artful boy; and in talking to
his friend, conscious that he had something to conceal, he was
perpetually on the point of betraying himself; then recollecting
his engagement, he blushed, stammered, bungled; and upon
Hardy&rsquo;s asking what he meant, would answer with a silly,
guilty countenance, that he did not know; or abruptly break off,
saying, &ldquo;Oh nothing! nothing at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in vain that he urged Tarlton to permit him to consult
his friend.&nbsp; A gloom overspread Tarlton&rsquo;s brow when he
began to speak on the subject, and he always returned a
peremptory refusal, accompanied with some such taunting
expression as this&mdash;&ldquo;I wish we had nothing to do with
such a sneaking fellow; he&rsquo;ll betray us all, I see, before
we have done with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Loveit to himself, &ldquo;so I am
abused after all, and called a sneaking fellow for my pains;
that&rsquo;s rather hard, to be sure, when I&rsquo;ve got so
little by the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In truth he had not got much; for in the division of the booty
only one apple, and half of another, which was only half ripe,
happened to fall to his share; though, to be sure, when they had
all eaten their apples, he had the satisfaction to hear everybody
declare they were very sorry they had forgotten to offer some of
theirs to &ldquo;<i>poor Loveit</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, the visits to the apple-tree had been now too
frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man who
lived in the cottage.&nbsp; He used to examine his only tree very
frequently, and missing numbers of rosy apples, which he had
watched ripening, he, though not prone to suspicion, began to
think that there was something going wrong; especially as a gap
was made in his hedge, and there were several small footsteps in
his flower beds.</p>
<p>The good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any
living creature, much less to children, of whom he was
particularly fond.&nbsp; Nor was he in the least avaricious, for
though he was not rich, he had enough to live upon, because he
had been very industrious in his youth; and he was always very
ready to part with the little he had.&nbsp; Nor was he a cross
old man.&nbsp; If anything would have made him angry, it would
have been the seeing his favourite tree robbed, as he had
promised himself the pleasure of giving his red apples to his
grandchildren on his birthday.&nbsp; However, he looked up at the
tree in sorrow rather than in anger, and leaning upon his staff,
he began to consider what he had best do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I complain to their master,&rdquo; said he to
himself, &ldquo;they will certainly be flogged, and that I should
be sorry for: yet they must not be let to go on stealing; that
would be worse still, for it would surely bring them to the
gallows in the end.&nbsp; Let me see&mdash;oh, ay, that will do;
I will borrow farmer Kent&rsquo;s dog Barker, he&rsquo;ll keep
them off, I&rsquo;ll answer for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farmer Kent lent his dog Barker, cautioning his neighbour, at
the same time, to be sure to chain him well, for he was the
fiercest mastiff in England.&nbsp; The old man, with farmer
Kent&rsquo;s assistance, chained him fast to the trunk of the
apple-tree.</p>
<p>Night came; and Tarlton, Loveit and his companions, returned
at the usual hour.&nbsp; Grown bolder now by frequent success,
they came on talking and laughing.&nbsp; But the moment they had
set their foot in the garden, the dog started up; and, shaking
the chain as he sprang forward, barked with unremitting
fury.&nbsp; They stood still as if fixed to the spot.&nbsp; There
was just moonlight enough to see the dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us try
the other side of the tree,&rdquo; said Tarlton.&nbsp; But to
whichever side they turned, the dog flew round in an instant,
barking with increased fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll break his chain and tear us to
pieces,&rdquo; cried Tarlton; and, struck with terror, he
immediately threw down the basket he had brought with him, and
betook himself to flight, with the greatest precipitation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Help me! oh, pray, help me!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t get
through the hedge,&rdquo; cried Loveit, in a lamentable tone,
whilst the dog growled hideously, and sprang forward to the
extremity of his chain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get out!&nbsp;
Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, stay for me one minute, dear
Tarlton!&rdquo;&nbsp; He called in vain; he was left to struggle
through his difficulties by himself; and of all his dear friends
not one turned back to help him.&nbsp; At last, torn and
terrified, he got through the hedge and ran home, despising his
companions for their selfishness.&nbsp; Nor could he help
observing that Tarlton, with all his vaunted prowess, was the
first to run away from the appearance of danger.</p>
<p>The next morning Loveit could not help reproaching the party
with their conduct.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why could not you, any of you,
stay one minute to help me?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not hear you call,&rdquo; answered one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so frightened,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;I
would not have turned back for the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Tarlton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Tarlton; &ldquo;had not I enough to do
to take care of myself, you blockhead?&nbsp; Everyone for himself
in this world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; said Loveit, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, man! is there anything strange in
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange! why, yes; I thought you all loved
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord love you, lad! so we do; but we love ourselves
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardy would not have served me so, however,&rdquo; said
Loveit, turning away in disgust.&nbsp; Tarlton was alarmed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pugh!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;what nonsense have you taken
into your brain!&nbsp; Think no more about it.&nbsp; We are all
very sorry, and beg your pardon; come, shake hands, forgive and
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loveit gave his hand, but gave it rather coldly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I forgive it with all my heart,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but
I cannot forget it so soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, you are not such a good humoured fellow as
we thought you were.&nbsp; Surely you cannot bear malice,
Loveit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Loveit smiled, and allowed that he certainly
could not bear malice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, come; you know at
the bottom we all love you, and would do anything in the world
for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Loveit, flattered in his foible, began
to believe that they did love him at the bottom, as they said,
and even with his eyes open consented again to be duped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange it is,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;that I
should set such value upon the love of those I despise!&nbsp;
When I&rsquo;m once out of this scrape, I&rsquo;ll have no more
to do with them, I&rsquo;m determined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compared with his friend Hardy, his new associates did indeed
appear contemptible; for all this time Hardy had treated him with
uniform kindness, avoided to pry into his secrets, yet seemed
ready to receive his confidence, if it had been offered.</p>
<p>After school in the evening, as he was standing silently
beside Hardy, who was ruling a sheet of paper for him, Tarlton,
in his brutal manner, came up, and seizing him by the arm, cried,
&ldquo;Come along with me, Loveit, I&rsquo;ve something to say to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come now,&rdquo; said Loveit, drawing
away his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, do come now,&rdquo; said Tarlton, in a voice of
persuasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but do, pray; there&rsquo;s a good fellow, come
now, because I have something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you&rsquo;ve got to say to me?&nbsp; I wish
you&rsquo;d let me alone,&rdquo; said Loveit; yet at the same
time he suffered himself to be led away.</p>
<p>Tarlton took particular pains to humour him and bring him into
temper again; and even though he was not very apt to part with
his playthings, went so far as to say, &ldquo;Loveit, the other
day you wanted a top; I&rsquo;ll give you mine if you desire
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loveit thanked him, and was overjoyed at the thought of
possessing this top.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what did you want to say to
me just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, we&rsquo;ll talk of that presently; not
yet&mdash;when we get out of hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody is near us,&rdquo; said Loveit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come a little farther however,&rdquo; said Tarlton,
looking round suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the dog that frightened us last
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will never frighten us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it? how so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Tarlton, drawing something from
his pocket wrapped in a blue handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;&nbsp; Tarlton opened
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Raw meat!&rdquo; exclaimed Loveit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How came you by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, the servant boy, Tom got it for me; and I&rsquo;m
to give him sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it for the dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I vowed I&rsquo;d be revenged on him, and after
this he&rsquo;ll never bark again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never bark again!&nbsp; What do you mean?&nbsp; Is it
poison?&rdquo; exclaimed Loveit, starting back with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only poison for <i>a dog</i>,&rdquo; said Tarlton,
confused; &ldquo;you could not look more shocking if it was
poison for a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tarlton,&rdquo; said he at last, in a changed tone and
altered manner, &ldquo;I did not know you; I will have no more to
do with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but stay,&rdquo; said Tarlton, catching hold of
his arm, &ldquo;stay; I was only joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go my arm&mdash;you were in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then that was before I knew there was any
harm.&nbsp; If you think there&rsquo;s any harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>If</i>,&rdquo; said Loveit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you know, I might not know; for Tom told me
it&rsquo;s a thing that&rsquo;s often done.&nbsp; Ask
Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask nobody!&nbsp; Surely we know better
what&rsquo;s right and wrong than Tom does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But only just ask him, to hear what he&rsquo;ll
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear what he&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo;
cried Loveit, vehemently: &ldquo;the dog will die in
agonies&mdash;in agonies!&nbsp; There was a dog poisoned at my
father&rsquo;s&mdash;I saw him in the yard.&nbsp; Poor
creature!&nbsp; He lay and howled and writhed himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor creature!&nbsp; Well, there&rsquo;s no harm done
now,&rdquo; cried Tarlton, in a hypocritical tone.&nbsp; But
though he thought fit to dissemble with Loveit, he was thoroughly
determined in his purpose.</p>
<p>Poor Loveit, in haste to get away, returned to his friend
Hardy; but his mind was in such agitation, that he neither talked
nor moved like himself; and two or three times his heart was so
full that he was ready to burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good-natured you are to me,&rdquo; said he to
Hardy, as he was trying vainly to entertain him; &ldquo;but if
you knew&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he stopped short, for the bell
for evening prayer rang, and they all took their places, and
knelt down.&nbsp; After prayers, as they were going to bed,
Loveit stopped Tarlton,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Well</i>!&rdquo; asked
he, in an inquiring manner, fixing his eyes upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Well</i>!&rdquo; replied Tarlton, in an audacious
tone, as if he meant to set his inquiring eye at defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go to sleep, as you do, I suppose,&rdquo; replied
Tarlton, turning away abruptly, and whistling as he walked
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he has certainly changed his mind!&rdquo; said
Loveit to himself, &ldquo;else he could not whistle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About ten minutes after this, as he and Hardy were undressing,
Hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon
the grass.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it will be
quite spoiled before morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Tom,&rdquo; said Loveit, &ldquo;and bid him bring
it in for you in a minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; They both went to the top
of the stairs to call Tom; no one answered.&nbsp; They called
again louder, &ldquo;Is Tom below?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; answered he at last, coming out
of Tarlton&rsquo;s room with a look of mixed embarrassment and
effrontery.&nbsp; And as he was receiving Hardy&rsquo;s
commission, Loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief
hanging out of his pocket.&nbsp; This excited fresh suspicions in
Loveit&rsquo;s mind; but, without saying one word, he immediately
stationed himself at the window in his room, which looked out
towards the lane; and, as the moon was risen, he could see if
anyone passed that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; said Hardy, after he
had been watching some time; &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you come to
bed?&rdquo;&nbsp; Loveit returned no answer, but continued
standing at the window.&nbsp; Nor did he watch long in
vain.&nbsp; Presently he saw Tom gliding slowly along a by-path,
and get over the gate into the lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to do it!&rdquo; exclaimed Loveit
aloud, with an emotion which he could not command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gone? to do what?&rdquo; cried Hardy,
starting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cruel! how wicked!&rdquo; continued Loveit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s cruel&mdash;what&rsquo;s wicked? speak out
at once!&rdquo; returned Hardy, in that commanding tone which, in
moments of danger, strong minds feel themselves entitled to
assume towards weak ones.&nbsp; Loveit instantly, though in an
incoherent manner, explained the affair to him.&nbsp; Scarcely
had the words passed his lips, when Hardy sprang up, and began
dressing himself without saying one syllable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, what are you going to do?&rdquo;
said Loveit, in great anxiety.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never
forgive me! don&rsquo;t betray me! they&rsquo;ll never forgive!
pray, speak to me! only say you won&rsquo;t betray us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not betray you, trust to me,&rdquo; said Hardy:
and he left the room, and Loveit stood in amazement; while, in
the meantime, Hardy, in hopes of overtaking Tom before the fate
of the poor dog was decided, ran with all possible speed across
the meadow, then down the lane.&nbsp; He came up with Tom just as
he was climbing the bank into the old man&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp;
Hardy, too much out of breath to speak, seized hold of him,
dragged him down, detaining him with a firm grasp, whilst he
panted for utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Master Hardy, is it you? what&rsquo;s the matter?
what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want the poisoned meat that you have in your
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that I had any such thing?&rdquo; said
Tom, clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it me quietly, and I&rsquo;ll let you
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, upon my word I haven&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said
Tom, trembling, though he was by far the stronger of the
two.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t know what you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do,&rdquo; said Hardy, with great indignation: and
a violent struggle immediately commenced.</p>
<p>The dog, now alarmed by the voices, began to bark
outrageously.&nbsp; Tom was terrified lest the old man should
come out to see what was the matter; his strength forsook him,
and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the hedge, he ran
away with all his speed.&nbsp; The handkerchief fell within reach
of the dog, who instantly snapped at it; luckily it did not come
untied.&nbsp; Hardy saw a pitchfork on a dunghill close beside
him, and, seizing upon it, stuck it into the handkerchief.&nbsp;
The dog pulled, tore, growled, grappled, yelled; it was
impossible to get the handkerchief from between his teeth; but
the knot was loosed, the meat, unperceived by the dog, dropped
out, and while he dragged off the handkerchief in triumph, Hardy,
with inexpressible joy, plunged the pitchfork into the poisoned
meat, and bore it away.</p>
<p>Never did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of
battle.&nbsp; Full of the pleasure of successful benevolence,
Hardy tripped joyfully home, and vaulted over the window sill,
when the first object he beheld was Mr. Power, the usher,
standing at the head of the stairs, with his candle in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up, whoever you are,&rdquo; said Mr. William
Power, in a stern voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought I should find you
out at last.&nbsp; Come up, whoever you are!&rdquo;&nbsp; Hardy
obeyed without reply.&mdash;&ldquo;Hardy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Power, starting back with astonishment; &ldquo;is it you, Mr.
Hardy?&rdquo; repeated he, holding the light to his face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said he, in a sneering tone,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure if Mr. Trueman was here he wouldn&rsquo;t
believe his own eyes; but for my part I saw through you long
since; I never liked saints, for my share.&nbsp; Will you please
to do me the favour, sir, if it is not too much trouble, to empty
your pockets.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hardy obeyed in silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heyday! meat! raw meat! what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Hardy, emptying his
pockets inside out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is <i>all</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Power, taking up
the meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said Hardy, eagerly, &ldquo;let that
meat be burned, it is poisoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poisoned!&rdquo; cried Mr. William Power, letting it
drop out of his fingers; &ldquo;you wretch!&rdquo; looking at him
with a menacing air: &ldquo;what is all this?&nbsp;
Speak.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hardy was silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo; cried he, shaking him by the
shoulder impatiently.&nbsp; Still Hardy was silent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Down upon your knees this minute and confess all: tell me
where you&rsquo;ve been, what you&rsquo;ve been doing, and who
are your accomplices, for I know there is a gang of you;
so,&rdquo; added he, pressing heavily upon Hardy&rsquo;s
shoulder, &ldquo;down upon your knees this minute, and confess
the whole, that&rsquo;s your only way now to get off
yourself.&nbsp; If you hope for <i>my</i> pardon, I can tell you
it&rsquo;s not to be had without asking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Hardy, in a firm but respectful voice,
&ldquo;I have no pardon to ask, I have nothing to confess; I am
innocent; but if I were not, I would never try to get off myself
by betraying my companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir! very well! very fine! stick to it,
stick to it, I advise you, and we shall see.&nbsp; And how will
you look to-morrow, Mr. Innocent, when my uncle, the doctor,
comes home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I do now, sir,&rdquo; said Hardy, unmoved.</p>
<p>His composure threw Mr. Power into a rage too great for
utterance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; continued Hardy, &ldquo;ever
since I have been at school, I never told a lie, and therefore,
sir, I hope you will believe me now.&nbsp; Upon my word and
honour, sir, I have done nothing wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong?&nbsp; Better and better! what, when I
caught you going out at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i>, to be sure, was wrong,&rdquo; said Hardy,
recollecting himself; &ldquo;but except that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except that, sir! I will except nothing.&nbsp; Come
along with me, young gentleman, your time for pardon is
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying these words, he pulled Hardy along a narrow passage to
a small closet, set apart for desperate offenders, and usually
known by the name of the <i>Black Hole</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;There,
sir, take up your lodging there for to-night,&rdquo; said he,
pushing him in; &ldquo;to-morrow I&rsquo;ll know more, or
I&rsquo;ll know why,&rdquo; added he, double locking the door,
with a tremendous noise, upon his prisoner, and locking also the
door at the end of the passage, so that no one could have access
to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;So now I think I have you safe!&rdquo; said
Mr. William Power to himself, stalking off with steps which made
the whole gallery resound, and which made many a guilty heart
tremble.</p>
<p>The conversation which had passed between Hardy and Mr. Power
at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to; but
only a word or two here and there had been distinctly
overheard.</p>
<p>The locking of the black hole door was a terrible
sound&mdash;some knew not what it portended, and others knew
<i>too well</i>.&nbsp; All assembled in the morning with faces of
anxiety.&nbsp; Tarlton and Loveit&rsquo;s were the most agitated:
Tarlton for himself, Loveit for his friend, for himself, for
everybody.&nbsp; Every one of the party, and Tarlton at their
head, surrounded him with reproaches; and considered him as the
author of the evils which hung over them.&nbsp; &ldquo;How could
you do so? and why did you say anything to Hardy about it? when
you had promised, too!&nbsp; Oh! what shall we all do? what a
scrape you have brought us into, Loveit, it&rsquo;s all your
fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my fault!&rdquo; repeated poor Loveit, with a sigh;
&ldquo;well, that is hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness! there&rsquo;s the bell,&rdquo; exclaimed a
number of voices at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They all stood in a half circle for morning prayers.&nbsp; They
listened&mdash;&ldquo;Here he is coming!&nbsp;
No&mdash;Yes&mdash;Here he is!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. William
Power, with a gloomy brow, appeared and walked up to his place at
the head of the room.&nbsp; They knelt down to prayers, and the
moment they rose, Mr. William Power, laying his hand upon the
table, cried, &ldquo;Stand still, gentlemen, if you
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everybody stood stock still; he walked out
of the circle; they guessed that he was gone for Hardy, and the
whole room was in commotion.&nbsp; Each with eagerness asked each
what none could answer, &ldquo;<i>Has he told</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>What</i> has he told?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who has he
told of?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope he has not told of me,&rdquo;
cried they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for it he has told of all of
us,&rdquo; said Tarlton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll answer for it he has told of none of
us,&rdquo; answered Loveit, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s such a fool, when he
can get himself off,&rdquo; said Tarlton.</p>
<p>At this instant the prisoner was led in, and as he passed
through the circle, every eye was fixed upon him.&nbsp; His eye
fell upon no one, not even upon Loveit, who pulled him by the
coat as he passed&mdash;everyone felt almost afraid to
breathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Power, sitting down in Mr.
Trueman&rsquo;s elbow-chair, and placing the prisoner opposite to
him; &ldquo;well, sir, what have you to say to me this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; answered Hardy, in a decided, yet
modest manner; &ldquo;nothing but what I said last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have something more to say to you, sir, then; and
a great deal more, I promise you, before I have done with
you;&rdquo; and then, seizing him in a fury, he was just going to
give him a severe flogging, when the schoolroom door opened, and
Mr. Trueman appeared, followed by an old man whom Loveit
immediately knew.&nbsp; He leaned upon his stick as he walked,
and in his other hand carried a basket of apples.&nbsp; When they
came within the circle, Mr. Trueman stopped short.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hardy!&rdquo; exclaimed he, with a voice of unfeigned
surprise, whilst Mr. William Power stood with his hand
suspended.&mdash;&ldquo;Ay, Hardy, sir,&rdquo; repeated he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I told him you&rsquo;d not believe your own
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Trueman advanced with a slow step.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, sir,
give me leave,&rdquo; said the usher, eagerly drawing him aside,
and whispering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. T. when the whisper was done,
addressing himself to Hardy, with a voice and manner which, had
he been guilty, must have pierced him to the heart, &ldquo;I find
I have been deceived in you; it is but three hours ago that I
told your uncle I never had a boy in my school in whom I placed
so much confidence; but, after all this show of honour and
integrity, the moment my back is turned, you are the first to set
an example of disobedience of my orders.&nbsp; Why do I talk of
disobeying my commands&mdash;you are a thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed Hardy, no longer able to
repress his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, sir,&mdash;you and some others,&rdquo; said Mr.
Trueman, looking round the room with a penetrating
glance&mdash;&ldquo;you and some others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. William Power,
&ldquo;get that out of him if you can&mdash;ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will ask him nothing; I shall neither put his truth
nor his honour to the trial; truth and honour are not to be
expected amongst thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a thief!&nbsp; I have never had anything to do
with thieves,&rdquo; cried Hardy, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you not robbed this old man?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
know the taste of these apples?&rdquo; said Mr. Trueman, taking
one out of the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I do not.&nbsp; I never touched one of that
old man&rsquo;s apples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never touched one of them!&nbsp; I suppose this is some
vile equivocation; you have done worse, you have had the
barbarity, the baseness, to attempt to poison his dog; the
poisoned meat was found in your pocket last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poisoned meat was found in my pocket, sir; but I
never intended to poison the dog&mdash;I saved his
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless him!&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense&mdash;cunning!&rdquo; said Mr. Power.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t let him impose upon you,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he cannot impose upon me; I have a proof he is
little prepared for,&rdquo; said Mr. Trueman, producing the blue
handkerchief in which the meat had been wrapped.</p>
<p>Tarlton turned pale; Hardy&rsquo;s countenance never
changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know this handkerchief, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know whose it is?&rdquo; cried Mr.
Power.&nbsp; Hardy was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Trueman, &ldquo;I am
not fond of punishing you; but when I do it, you know, it is
always in earnest.&nbsp; I will begin with the eldest of you; I
will begin with Hardy, and flog you with my own hands till this
handkerchief is owned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not mine,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s none of mine,&rdquo; burst from
every mouth, whilst they looked at each other in dismay; for none
but Hardy, Loveit and Tarlton knew the secret.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
cane,&rdquo; said Mr. Trueman, and Mr. Power handed him the
cane.&nbsp; Loveit groaned from the bottom of his heart.&nbsp;
Tarlton leaned back against the wall with a black
countenance.&nbsp; Hardy looked with a steady eye at the
cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first,&rdquo; said Mr. Trueman, laying down the
cane, &ldquo;let us see.&nbsp; Perhaps we may find out the owner
of this handkerchief another way,&rdquo; examining the
corners.&nbsp; It was torn almost to pieces; but luckily the
corner that was marked remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J. T.!&rdquo; cried Mr. Trueman.&nbsp; Every eye turned
upon the guilty Tarlton, who, now as pale as ashes and trembling
in every limb, sank down upon his knees, and in a whining voice
begged for mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my word and honour, sir,
I&rsquo;ll tell you all; I&rsquo;d never have thought of stealing
the apples if Loveit had not first told me of them; and it was
Tom who first put the poisoning the dog into my head.&nbsp; It
was he that carried the meat, <i>wasn&rsquo;t it</i>?&rdquo; said
he, appealing to Hardy, whose word he knew must be
believed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear sir!&rdquo; continued he as Mr.
Trueman began to move towards him, &ldquo;do let me off; pray do
let me off this time!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not the only one, indeed,
sir! I hope you won&rsquo;t make me an example for the
rest.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very hard I&rsquo;m to be flogged more
than they!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to flog you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Tarlton, getting up and
wiping his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not thank me,&rdquo; said Mr. Trueman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take your handkerchief&mdash;go out of this room&mdash;out
of this house; let me never see you more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had any hopes of him,&rdquo; said Mr. Trueman, as
he shut the door after him;&mdash;&ldquo;if I had any hopes of
him, I would have punished him;&mdash;but I have none.&nbsp;
Punishment is meant only to make people better; and those who
have any hopes of themselves will know how to submit to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words Loveit first, and immediately all the rest of
the guilty party, stepped out of the ranks, confessed their
fault, and declared themselves ready to bear any punishment their
master thought proper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they have been punished enough,&rdquo; said the old
man; &ldquo;forgive them, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardy looked as if he wished to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
because you ask it,&rdquo; said Mr. Trueman to the guilty
penitents, &ldquo;though I should be glad to oblige you&mdash;it
wouldn&rsquo;t be just; but there,&rdquo; pointing to Hardy,
&ldquo;there is one who has merited a reward; the highest I can
give him is that of pardoning his companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure, whilst
everybody present sympathized in his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; thought Loveit, &ldquo;this is a
lesson I shall never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the old man, with a faltering
voice, &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t for the sake of my apples that I
spoke; and you, sir,&rdquo; said he to Hardy, &ldquo;I thank you
for saving my dog.&nbsp; If you please, I&rsquo;ll plant on that
mount, opposite the window, a young apple-tree, from my old
one.&nbsp; I will water it, and take care of it with my own hands
for your sake, as long as I am able.&nbsp; And may God bless
you!&rdquo; laying his trembling hand on Hardy&rsquo;s head;
&ldquo;may God bless you&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure God <i>will</i>
bless all such boys as you are.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the foot of a steep, slippery,
white hill, near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, called Chalk Hill,
there is a hut, or rather a hovel, which travellers could
scarcely suppose could be inhabited, if they did not see the
smoke rising from its peaked roof.&nbsp; An old woman lives in
this hovel, <a name="citation365b"></a><a href="#footnote365b"
class="citation">[365b]</a> and with her a little boy and girl,
the children of a beggar who died, and left these orphans
perishing with hunger.&nbsp; They thought themselves very happy
when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid them
warm themselves at her small fire, and gave them a crust of
mouldy bread to eat.&nbsp; She had not much to give, but what she
had she gave with good-will.&nbsp; She was very kind to these
poor children, and worked hard at her spinning-wheel and at her
knitting, to support herself and them.&nbsp; She earned money
also in another way.&nbsp; She used to follow all the carriages
as they went up Chalk Hill, and when the horses stopped to take
breath or to rest themselves, she put stones behind the carriage
wheels to prevent them from rolling backwards down the steep,
slippery hill.</p>
<p>The little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured
old woman&rsquo;s spinning-wheel when she was spinning, and to
talk to her.&nbsp; At these times she taught them something,
which, she said, she hoped they would remember all their
lives.&nbsp; She explained to them what is meant by telling the
truth, and what it is to be honest.&nbsp; She taught them to
dislike idleness, and to wish that they could be useful.</p>
<p>One evening, as they were standing beside her, the little boy
said to her, &ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; for that was the name by
which she liked that these children should call
her&mdash;&ldquo;grandmother, how often you are forced to get up
from your spinning-wheel, and to follow the chaises and coaches
up that steep hill, to put stones underneath the wheels, to
hinder them from rolling back!&nbsp; The people who are in the
carriages give you a halfpenny or a penny for doing this,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is very hard work for you to go up and down that
hill.&nbsp; You often say that you are tired, and then you know
that you cannot spin all that time.&nbsp; Now if we might go up
the hill, and put the stones behind the wheels, you could sit
still at your work, and would not the people give us the
halfpence? and could not we bring them all to you?&nbsp; Do,
pray, dear grandmother, try us for one day&mdash;to-morrow, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;I will try what
you can do; but I must go up the hill along with you for the
first two or three times, for fear you should get yourselves
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, the next day, the little boy and girl went with their
grandmother, as they used to call her, up the steep hill; and she
showed the boy how to prevent the wheels from rolling back, by
putting stones behind them; and she said, &ldquo;This is called
scotching the wheels;&rdquo; and she took off the boy&rsquo;s hat
and gave it to the little girl, to hold up to the
carriage-windows, ready for the halfpence.</p>
<p>When she thought that the children knew how to manage by
themselves, she left them, and returned to her
spinning-wheel.&nbsp; A great many carriages happened to go by
this day, and the little girl received a great many
halfpence.&nbsp; She carried them all in her brother&rsquo;s hat
to her grandmother in the evening; and the old woman smiled, and
thanked the children.&nbsp; She said that they had been useful to
her, and that her spinning had gone on finely, because she had
been able to sit still at her wheel all day.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
Paul my boy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what is the matter with your
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a pinch&mdash;only one pinch that I got, as I was
putting a stone behind a wheel of a chaise.&nbsp; It does not
hurt me much, grandmother; and I&rsquo;ve thought of a good thing
for to-morrow.&nbsp; I shall never be hurt again, if you will
only be so good as to give me the old handle of the broken
crutch, grandmother, and the block of wood that lies in the
chimney-corner, and that is of no use.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make it
of some use, if I may have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it then, dear,&rdquo; said the old woman;
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll find the handle of the broken crutch
under my bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul went to work immediately, and fastened one end of the
pole into the block of wood, so as to make something like a
dry-rubbing brush.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look, grandmamma, look at my
<i>scotcher</i>.&nbsp; I call this thing my
<i>scotcher</i>,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;because I shall always
scotch the wheels with it.&nbsp; I shall never pinch my fingers
again; my hands, you see, will be safe at the end of this long
stick; and, sister Anne, you need not be at the trouble of
carrying any more stones after me up the hill; we shall never
want stones any more.&nbsp; My scotcher will do without anything
else, I hope.&nbsp; I wish it was morning, and that a carriage
would come, that I might run up the hill, and try my
scotcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wish that as many chaises may go by to-morrow as
there did to-day, and that we may bring you as many halfpence,
grandmother,&rdquo; said the little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, my dear Anne,&rdquo; said the old woman;
&ldquo;for I mean that you and your brother shall have all the
money that you get to-morrow.&nbsp; You may buy some gingerbread
for yourselves, or some of those ripe plums that you saw at the
fruit-stall the other day, which is just going into
Dunstable.&nbsp; I told you then that I could not afford to buy
such things for you; but now that you can earn halfpence for
yourselves, children, it is fair should taste a ripe plum and bit
of gingerbread for once and a way in your lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring some of the gingerbread home to her,
shan&rsquo;t we, brother?&rdquo; whispered little Anne.&nbsp; The
morning came; but no carriages were heard, though Paul and his
sister had risen at five o&rsquo;clock, that they might be sure
to be ready for early travellers.&nbsp; Paul kept his scotcher
poised upon his shoulder, and watched eagerly at his station at
the bottom of the hill.&nbsp; He did not wait long before a
carriage came.&nbsp; He followed it up the hill; and the instant
the postillion called to him, and bid him stop the wheels, he put
his scotcher behind them, and found that it answered the purpose
perfectly well.</p>
<p>Many carriages went by this day, and Paul and Anne received a
great many halfpence from the travellers.</p>
<p>When it grew dusk in the evening, Anne said to her
brother&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any more carriages will
come by to-day.&nbsp; Let us count the halfpence, and carry them
home now to grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; answered Paul, &ldquo;let them
alone&mdash;let them lie still in the hole where I have put
them.&nbsp; I daresay more carriages will come by before it is
quite dark, and then we shall have more halfpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul had taken the halfpence out of his hat, and he had put
them into a hole in the high bank by the roadside; and Anne said
she would not meddle with them, and that she would wait till her
brother liked to count them; and Paul said&mdash;&ldquo;If you
will stay and watch here, I will go and gather some blackberries
for you in the hedge in yonder field.&nbsp; Stand you hereabouts,
half-way up the hill, and the moment you see any carriage coming
along the road, run as fast as you can and call me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne waited a long time, or what she thought a long time; and
she saw no carriage, and she trailed her brother&rsquo;s scotcher
up and down till she was tired.&nbsp; Then she stood still, and
looked again, and she saw no carriage; so she went sorrowfully
into the field, and to the hedge where her brother was gathering
blackberries, and she said, &ldquo;Paul, I&rsquo;m sadly tired,
<i>sadly tired</i>!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and my eyes are quite
strained with looking for chaises; no more chaises will come
to-night; and your scotcher is lying there, of no use, upon the
ground.&nbsp; Have not I waited long enough for to-day,
Paul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Paul; &ldquo;here are some
blackberries for you; you had better wait a little bit
longer.&nbsp; Perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are
standing here talking to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne, who was of a very obliging temper, and who liked to do
what she was asked to do, went back to the place where the
scotcher lay; and scarcely had she reached the spot, when she
heard the noise of a carriage.&nbsp; She ran to call her brother,
and to their great joy, they now saw four chaises coming towards
them.&nbsp; Paul, as soon as they went up the hill, followed with
his scotcher; first he scotched the wheels of one carriage, then
of another; and Anne was so much delighted with observing how
well the scotcher stopped the wheels, and how much better it was
than stones, that she forgot to go and hold her brother&rsquo;s
hat to the travellers for halfpence, till she was roused by the
voice of a little rosy girl, who was looking out of the window of
one of the chaises.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come close to the
chaise-door,&rdquo; said the little girl; &ldquo;here are some
halfpence for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne held the hat; and she afterwards went on to the other
carriages.&nbsp; Money was thrown to her from each of them; and
when they had all gotten safely to the top of the hill, she and
her brother sat down upon a large stone by the roadside, to count
their treasure.&nbsp; First they began by counting what was in
the hat&mdash;&ldquo;One, two, three, four halfpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, oh, brother, look at this!&rdquo; exclaimed Anne;
&ldquo;this is not the same as the other halfpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, it is not,&rdquo; cried Paul, &ldquo;it is
no halfpenny; it is a guinea, a bright golden guinea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Anne, who had never seen a guinea in
her life before, and who did not know its value; &ldquo;and will
it do as well as a halfpenny to buy gingerbread?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
run to the fruit-stall, and ask the woman; shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;you need not ask any
woman, or anybody but me; I can tell you all about it, as well as
anybody in the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole world!&nbsp; Oh, Paul, you forgot.&nbsp; Not
so well as my grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not so well as my grandmother, perhaps, but, Anne,
I can tell you that you must not talk yourself, Anne, but you
must listen to me quietly, or else you won&rsquo;t understand
what I am going to tell you, for I can assure you that I
don&rsquo;t think I quite understood it myself, Anne, the first
time my grandmother told it to me, though I stood stock still
listening my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prepared by this speech to hear something very difficult to be
understood, Anne looked very grave, and her brother explained to
her, that, with a guinea, she might buy two hundred and fifty-two
times as many plums as she could get for a penny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Paul, you know the fruit-woman said she would give
us a dozen plums for a penny.&nbsp; Now, for this little guinea,
would she give us two hundred and fifty-two dozen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she has so many, and if we like to have so many, to
be sure she will,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;but I think we should
not like to have two hundred and fifty-two dozen of plums; we
could not eat such a number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we could give some of them to my
grandmother,&rdquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still there would be too many for her, and for us,
too,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;and when we had eaten the plums,
there would be an end to all the pleasure.&nbsp; But now
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I am thinking of, Anne, that we might
buy something for my grandmother, that would be very useful to
her indeed, with the guinea&mdash;something that would last a
great while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, brother?&nbsp; What sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something that she said she wanted very much last
winter, when she was so ill with the rheumatism&mdash;something
that she said yesterday, when you were making her bed, she wished
she might be able to buy before next winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know what you mean!&rdquo; said
Anne&mdash;&ldquo;a blanket.&nbsp; Oh, yes, Paul, that will be
much better than plums; do let us buy a blanket for her; how glad
she will be to see it!&nbsp; I will make her bed with the new
blanket, and then bring her to see it.&nbsp; But, Paul, how shall
we buy a blanket?&nbsp; Where are blankets to be got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me, I&rsquo;ll manage that.&nbsp; I know
where blankets can be got.&nbsp; I saw one hanging out of a shop
the day I went last to Dunstable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen a great many things at Dunstable,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a great many; but I never saw anything there or
anywhere else, that I wished for half so much as I did for the
blanket for my grandmother.&nbsp; Do you remember how she used to
shiver with the cold last winter?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll buy the
blanket to-morrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to Dunstable with her
spinning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll bring the blanket to me, and I shall
make the bed very neatly, that will be all right&mdash;all
happy!&rdquo; said Anne, clapping her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stay!&nbsp; Hush! don&rsquo;t clap your hands so,
Anne; it will not be all happy, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said
Paul, and his countenance changed, and he looked very
grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will not be all right, I&rsquo;m afraid,
for there is one thing we have neither of us thought of, but that
we ought to think about.&nbsp; We cannot buy the blanket,
I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Paul, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t think this guinea is honestly
ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, brother, but I&rsquo;m sure it is honestly
ours.&nbsp; It was given to us, and grandmother said all that was
given to us to-day was to be our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who gave it to you, Anne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the people in those chaises, Paul.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know which of them, but I daresay it was the little
rosy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;for when she called you to
the chaise door, she said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s some halfpence for
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, if she gave you the guinea, she must have
given it to you by mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but perhaps some of the people in the other
chaises gave it to me, and did not give it to me by mistake,
Paul.&nbsp; There was a gentleman reading in one of the chaises
and a lady, who looked very good-naturedly at me, and then the
gentleman put down his book and put his head out of the window,
and looked at your scotcher, brother, and he asked me if that was
your own making; and when I said yes, and that I was your sister
he smiled at me, and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and
threw a handful of halfpence into the hat, and I daresay he gave
us the guinea along with them because he liked your scotcher so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;that might be, to be
sure, but I wish I was quite certain of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as we are not quite certain, had not we best go
and ask my grandmother what she thinks about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul thought this was excellent advice; and he was not a silly
boy, who did not like to follow good advice.&nbsp; He went with
his sister directly to his grandmother, showed her the guinea,
and told her how they came by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, honest children,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am
very glad you told me all this.&nbsp; I am very glad that you did
not buy either the plums or the blanket with this guinea.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure it is not honestly ours.&nbsp; Those who threw it
you gave it you by mistake, I warrant; and what I would have you
do is, to go to Dunstable, and try if you can, at either of the
inns find out the person who gave it to you.&nbsp; It is now so
late in the evening that perhaps the travellers will sleep at
Dunstable, instead of going on the next stage; and it is likely
that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of a halfpenny has found
out their mistake by this time.&nbsp; All you can do is to go and
inquire for the gentleman who was reading in the
chaise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; interrupted Paul, &ldquo;I know a good way
of finding him out.&nbsp; I remember it was a dark green chaise
with red wheels: and I remember I read the innkeeper&rsquo;s name
upon the chaise, &lsquo;<i>John Nelson</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; (I am
much obliged to you for teaching me to read, grandmother.)&nbsp;
You told me yesterday, grandmother, that the names written upon
chaises are the innkeepers to whom they belong.&nbsp; I read the
name of the innkeeper upon that chaise.&nbsp; It was John
Nelson.&nbsp; So Anne and I will go to both the inns in
Dunstable, and try to find out this chaise&mdash;John
Nelson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Come, Anne; let us set out before it gets
quite dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne and her brother passed with great courage the tempting
stall that was covered with gingerbread and ripe plums, and
pursued their way steadily through the streets of Dunstable; but
Paul, when he came to the shop where he had seen the blanket,
stopped for a moment, and said, &ldquo;It is a great pity, Anne,
that the guinea is not ours.&nbsp; However, we are doing what is
honest, and that is a comfort.&nbsp; Here, we must go through
this gateway, into the inn-yard; we are come to the &lsquo;Dun
Cow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cow!&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;I see no cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up, and you&rsquo;ll see the cow over your
head,&rdquo; said Paul&mdash;&ldquo;the sign&mdash;the
picture.&nbsp; Come, never mind looking at it now; I want to find
out the green chaise that has John Nelson&rsquo;s name upon
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul pushed forward, through a crowded passage, till he got
into the inn-yard.&nbsp; There was a great noise and
bustle.&nbsp; The hostlers were carrying in luggage.&nbsp; The
postillions were rubbing down the horses, or rolling the chaises
into the coach-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now!&nbsp; What business have you here,
pray?&rdquo; said a waiter, who almost ran over Paul, as he was
crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some empty bottles from
the bottle-rack.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no business here,
crowding up the yard.&nbsp; Walk off, young gentleman, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray give me leave, sir,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;to
stay a few minutes, to look amongst these chaises for one dark
green chaise with red wheels, that has Mr. John Nelson&rsquo;s
name written upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that he says about a dark green
chaise?&rdquo; said one of the postillions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should such a one as he is know about
chaises?&rdquo; interrupted the hasty waiter, and he vas going to
turn Paul out of the yard; but the hostler caught hold of his arm
and said, &ldquo;Maybe the child has some business here;
let&rsquo;s know what he has to say for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter was at this instant luckily obliged to leave them
to attend the bell; and Paul told his business to the hostler,
who as soon as he saw the guinea and heard the story, shook Paul
by the hand, and said, &ldquo;Stand steady, my honest lad;
I&rsquo;ll find the chaise for you, if it is to be found here;
but John Nelson&rsquo;s chaises almost always drive to the
&lsquo;Black Bull.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some difficulty, the green chaise, with John
Nelson&rsquo;s name upon it, and the postillion who drove that
chaise, were found; and the postillion told Paul that he was just
going into the parlour to the gentleman he had driven, to be
paid, and that he would carry the guinea with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;we should like to give it
back ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the hostler; &ldquo;that they have a
right to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postillion made no reply, but looked vexed, and went
towards the house, desiring the children would wait in the
passage till his return.&nbsp; In the passage there was standing
a decent, clean, good natured looking woman, with two huge straw
baskets on each side of her.&nbsp; One of the baskets stood a
little in the way of the entrance.&nbsp; A man who was pushing
his way in, and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung
to a pole, impatient at being stopped, kicked down the straw
basket, and all its contents were thrown out.&nbsp; Bright straw
hats, and boxes, and slippers, were all thrown in disorder upon
the dirty ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they will be trampled upon!&nbsp; They will be all
spoiled!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman to whom they belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you to pick them up if you will let
us,&rdquo; cried Paul and Anne; and they immediately ran to her
assistance.</p>
<p>When the things were all safe in the basket again, the
children expressed a desire to know how such beautiful things
could be made of straw; but the woman had not time to answer
before the postillion came out of the parlour, and with him a
gentleman&rsquo;s servant, who came to Paul, and clapping him
upon the back, said, &ldquo;So, my little chap, I gave you a
guinea for a halfpenny, I hear; and I understand you&rsquo;ve
brought it back again; that&rsquo;s right, give me hold of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;this is not the
gentleman that was reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, child, I came in Mr. Nelson&rsquo;s green
chaise.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the postillion can tell you so.&nbsp;
I and my master came in that chaise.&nbsp; I and my master that
was reading, as you say, and it was he that threw the money out
to you.&nbsp; He is going to bed; he is tired and can&rsquo;t see
you himself.&nbsp; He desires that you&rsquo;ll give me the
guinea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed them towards the door; but the basket-woman
whispered to them as they went out, &ldquo;Wait in the street
till I come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, Mrs. Landlady,&rdquo; cried this
gentleman&rsquo;s servant, addressing himself to the landlady,
who just then came out of a room where some company were at
supper, &ldquo;Pray, Mrs. Landlady, please to let me have roasted
larks for my supper.&nbsp; You are famous for larks at Dunstable;
and I make it a rule to taste the best of everything wherever I
go; and, waiter, let me have a bottle of claret.&nbsp; Do you
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larks and claret for his supper,&rdquo; said the
basket-woman to herself, as she looked at him from head to
foot.&nbsp; The postillion was still waiting, as if to speak to
him; and she observed them afterwards whispering and laughing
together.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>No bad hit</i>,&rdquo; was a sentence
which the servant pronounced several times.</p>
<p>Now it occurred to the basket-woman that this man had cheated
the children out of the guinea to pay for the larks and claret;
and she thought that perhaps she could discover the truth.&nbsp;
She waited quietly in the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiter! Joe! Joe!&rdquo; cried the landlady, &ldquo;why
don&rsquo;t you carry in the sweetmeat-puffs and the tarts here
to the company in the best parlour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered the waiter; and
with a large dish of tarts and puffs, the waiter came from the
bar; the landlady threw open the door of the best parlour, to let
him in; and the basket-woman had now a full view of a large
cheerful company, and amongst them several children, sitting
round a supper-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; whispered the landlady, as the door closed
after the waiter and the tarts, &ldquo;there are customers
enough, I warrant, for you in that room, if you had but the luck
to be called in.&nbsp; Pray, what would you have the conscience,
I wonder now, to charge me for these here half-dozen little mats
to put under my dishes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trifle, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the
basket-woman.&nbsp; She let the landlady have the mats cheap, and
the landlady then declared she would step in and see if the
company in the best parlour had done supper.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
they come to their wine,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
speak a good word for you, and get you called in afore the
children are sent to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlady, after the usual speech of, &ldquo;<i>I hope the
supper and everything is to your liking</i>, <i>ladies and
gentlemen</i>,&rdquo; began with, &ldquo;If any of the young
gentlemen or ladies would have a <i>cur&rsquo;osity</i> to see
any of our famous Dunstable straw-work, there&rsquo;s a decent
body without would, I daresay, be proud to show them her
pincushion-boxes, and her baskets and slippers, and her other
<i>cur&rsquo;osities</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the children all turned towards their mother;
their mother smiled, and immediately their father called in the
basket-woman, and desired her to produce her
<i>curiosities</i>.&nbsp; The children gathered round her large
pannier as it opened, but they did not touch any of her
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, papa!&rdquo; cried a little rosy girl, &ldquo;here
are a pair of straw slippers that would just fit you, I think;
but would not straw shoes wear out very soon? and would not they
let in the wet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;but these
slippers are meant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For powdering-slippers, miss,&rdquo; interrupted the
basket-woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To wear when people are powdering their hair,&rdquo;
continued the gentleman, &ldquo;that they may not spoil their
other shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you buy them, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot indulge myself,&rdquo; said her father,
&ldquo;in buying them now.&nbsp; I must make amends,&rdquo; said
he, laughing, &ldquo;for my carelessness; and as I threw away a
guinea to-day, I must endeavour to save sixpence at
least?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the guinea that you threw by mistake into the
little girl&rsquo;s hat as we were coming up Chalk Hill.&nbsp;
Mamma, I wonder that the little girl did not take notice of its
being a guinea, and that she did not run after the chaise to give
it back again.&nbsp; I should think, if she had been an honest
girl, she would have returned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss!&mdash;ma&rsquo;am!&mdash;sir!&rdquo; said the
basket-woman, &ldquo;if it would not be impertinent, may I speak
a word?&nbsp; A little boy and girl have just been here inquiring
for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a halfpenny by
mistake; and not five minutes ago I saw the boy give the guinea
to a gentleman&rsquo;s servant, who is there without, and who
said his master desired it should be returned to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some mistake, or some trick in
this,&rdquo; said the gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are the children
gone?&nbsp; I must see them&mdash;send after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for them myself,&rdquo; said the good
natured basket-woman; &ldquo;I bid them wait in the street
yonder, for my mind misgave me that the man who spoke so short to
them was a cheat, with his larks and his claret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul and Anne were speedily summoned, and brought back by
their friend the basket-woman; and Anne, the moment she saw the
gentleman, knew that he was the very person who smiled upon her,
who admired her brother&rsquo;s scotcher, and who threw a handful
of halfpence into the hat; but she could not be certain, she
said, that she received the guinea from him; she only thought it
most likely that she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can be certain whether the guinea you returned be
mine or no,&rdquo; said the gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I marked the
guinea; it was a light one; the only guinea I had, which I put
into my waistcoat pocket this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; He rang the
bell, and desired the waiter to let the gentleman who was in the
room opposite to him know that he wished to see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman in the white parlour, sir, do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the master of the servant who received a guinea
from this child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a Mr. Pembroke, sir,&rdquo; said the waiter.</p>
<p>Mr. Pembroke came; and as soon as he heard what had happened,
he desired the waiter to show him to the room where his servant
was at supper.&nbsp; The dishonest servant, who was supping upon
larks and claret, knew nothing of what was going on; but his
knife and fork dropped from his hand, and he overturned a bumper
of claret as he started up from the table, in great surprise and
terror, when his master came in with a face of indignation, and
demanded &ldquo;<i>The guinea</i>&mdash;the <i>guinea</i>,
<i>sir</i>! that you got from this child; that guinea which you
said I ordered you to ask for from this child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant, confounded and half intoxicated, could only
stammer out that he had more guineas than one about him, and that
he really did not know which it was.&nbsp; He pulled his money
out, and spread it upon the table with trembling hands.&nbsp; The
marked guinea appeared.&nbsp; His master instantly turned him out
of his service with strong expressions of contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my little honest girl,&rdquo; said the
gentleman who had admired her brother&rsquo;s scotcher, turning
to Anne, &ldquo;and now tell me who you are, and what you and
your brother want or wish for most in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same moment Anne and Paul exclaimed, &ldquo;The thing
we wish for the most in the world is a blanket for our
grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not our grandmother in reality, I believe,
sir,&rdquo; said Paul; &ldquo;but she is just as good to us, and
taught me to read, and taught Anne to knit, and taught us both
that we should be honest&mdash;so she has; and I wish she had a
new blanket before next winter, to keep her from the cold and the
rheumatism.&nbsp; She had the rheumatism sadly last winter, sir;
and there is a blanket in this street that would be just the
thing for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall have it, then; and,&rdquo; continued the
gentleman, &ldquo;I will do something more for you.&nbsp; Do you
like to be employed or to be idle best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like to have something to do always, if we could,
sir,&rdquo; said Paul; &ldquo;but we are forced to be idle
sometimes, because grandmother has not always things for us to do
that we <i>can</i> do well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you like to learn how to make such baskets as
these?&rdquo; said the gentleman, pointing to one of the
Dunstable straw-baskets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, very much!&rdquo; said
Paul.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very much!&rdquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I should like to teach you how to make
them,&rdquo; said the basket-woman; &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m sure of
one thing, that you&rsquo;d behave honestly to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman put a guinea into the good natured
basket-woman&rsquo;s hand, and told her that he knew she could
not afford to teach them her trade for nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall come through Dunstable again in a few months,&rdquo; added
he; &ldquo;and I hope to see that you and your scholars are going
on well.&nbsp; If I find that they are, I will do something more
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;we must tell all this to
grandmother, and ask her about it; and I&rsquo;m
afraid&mdash;though I&rsquo;m very happy&mdash;that it is getting
very late, and that we should not stay here any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fine moonlight night,&rdquo; said the
basket-woman; &ldquo;and is not far.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll walk with
you, and see you safe home myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman detained them a few minutes longer, till a
messenger whom he had dispatched to purchase the much wished for
blanket returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grandmother will sleep well upon this good
blanket, I hope,&rdquo; said the gentleman, as he gave it into
Paul&rsquo;s opened arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been obtained for
her by the honesty of her adopted children.&rdquo;</p>

rush,&rdquo; says White, in his &lsquo;Natural History of
Selborne,&rsquo; &ldquo;seems to be the Juncus effusus, or common
soft rush, which is to be found in moist pastures, by the sides
of streams, and under hedges.&nbsp; These rushes are in best
condition in the height of summer, but may be gathered so as to
serve the purpose well quite on to autumn.&nbsp; The largest and
longest are the best.&nbsp; Decayed labourers, women, and
children make it their business to procure and prepare
them.&nbsp; As soon as they are cut, they must be flung into
water, and kept there; for otherwise they will dry and shrink,
and the peel will not run.&nbsp; When these junci are thus far
prepared, they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take
the dew for some nights, and afterwards be dried in the
sun.&nbsp; Some address is required in dipping these rushes in
the scalding fat or grease; but this knack is also to be attained
by practice.&nbsp; A pound of common grease may be procured for
fourpence, and about six pounds of grease will dip a pound of
rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought for one shilling; so
that a pound of rushes, medicated and ready for use, will cost
three shillings.&rdquo;</p>

Mr. Shaw, master of the Lichfield Grammar School, led, and
successfully conducted, &ldquo;a plan for <i>barring out</i> his
master.&nbsp; A disorderly privilege,&rdquo; says the doctor,
&ldquo;which, in his time, prevailed in the principal seminaries
of education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> of 1828, Dr. P. A.
Nuttall, under the signature of H. A. N., has given a spirited
sketch of a &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Barring Out</span>&rdquo;
at the Ormskirk Grammar School, which has since been republished
at length (though without acknowledgment), by Sir Henry Ellis, in
Bohn&rsquo;s recent edition of Brand&rsquo;s &ldquo;Popular
Antiquities.&rdquo;&nbsp; This operation took place early in the
present century, and is interesting from its being, perhaps, the
last attempt on record, and also from the circumstance of the
writer himself having been one of the juvenile leaders in the
daring adventure, &ldquo;quo rum pars magna
fuit.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.</p>

class="footnote">[326]</a>&nbsp; We must give those of our young
English readers who may not be acquainted with the ancient city
of Herculaneum, some idea of it.&nbsp; None can be ignorant that
near Naples is the celebrated volcanic mountain of
Vesuvius;&mdash;that, from time to time, there happen violent
eruptions from this mountain; that is to say, flames and immense
clouds of smoke issue from different openings, mouths, or
<i>craters</i>, as they are called, but more especially from the
summit of the mountain, which is distinguished by the name of
<i>the</i> crater.&nbsp; A rumbling, and afterwards a roaring
noise is heard within, and prodigious quantities of stones and
minerals burnt into masses (scori&aelig;), are thrown out of the
crater, sometimes to a great distance.&nbsp; The hot ashes from
Mount Vesuvius have often been seen upon the roofs of the houses
of Naples, from which it is six miles distant.&nbsp; Streams of
lava run down the sides of the mountains during the time of an
eruption, destroying everything in their way, and overwhelm the
houses and vineyards which are in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>About 1700 years ago, during the reign of the Roman Emperor
Titus, there happened a terrible eruption of Mount Vesuvius; and
a large city called Herculaneum, which was situated at about four
miles&rsquo; distance from the volcano, was overwhelmed by the
streams of lava which poured into it, filled up the streets, and
quickly covered over the tops of the houses, so that the whole
was no more visible.&nbsp; It remained for many years
buried.&nbsp; The lava which covered it became in time fit for
vegetation, plants grew there, a new soil was formed, and a new
town called Portici was built over this place where Herculaneum
formerly stood.&nbsp; The little village of Resina is also
situated near the spot.&nbsp; About fifty years ago, in a poor
man&rsquo;s garden at Resina, a hole in a well about thirty feet
below the surface of the earth was observed.&nbsp; Some persons
had the curiosity to enter into this hole, and, after creeping
underground for some time, they came to the foundations of
houses.&nbsp; The peasants, inhabitants of the village, who had
probably never heard of Herculaneum, were somewhat surprised at
their discovery. <a name="citation327"></a><a href="#footnote327"
class="citation">[327]</a>&nbsp; About the same time, in a pit in
the town of Portici, a similar passage underground was
discovered, and, by orders of the King of Naples, workmen were
employed to dig away the earth, and clear the passage.&nbsp; They
found, at length, the entrance into the town, which, during the
reign of Titus, was buried under lava.&nbsp; It was about
eighty-eight Neapolitan palms (a palm contains near nine inches)
below the top of the pit.&nbsp; The workmen, as they cleared the
passages, marked their way with chalk when they came to any
turning, lest they should lose themselves.&nbsp; The streets
branched out in many directions, and, lying across them, the
workmen often found large pieces of timber, beams, and rafters;
some broken in the fall, others entire.&nbsp; These beams and
rafters are burned quite black like charcoal, except those that
were found in moist places, which have more the colour of rotten
wood, and which are like a soft paste, into which you might run
your hand.&nbsp; The walls of the houses slant, some one way,
some another, and some are upright.&nbsp; Several magnificent
buildings of brick, faced with marble of different colours, are
partly seen, where the workmen have cleared away the earth and
lava with which they were encrusted.&nbsp; Columns of red and
white marble, and flights of steps, are seen in different places;
and out of the ruins of the palaces some very fine statues and
pictures have been dug.&nbsp; Foreigners who visit Naples are
very curious to see this subterraneous city, and are desirous to
carry with them into their own country some proofs of their
having examined this wonderful place.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
